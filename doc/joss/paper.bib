@article{Grimm2020,
abstract = {The Overview, Design concepts and Details (ODD) protocol for describing Individual-and Agent-Based Models (ABMs) is now widely accepted and used to document such models in journal articles. As a standardized document for providing a consistent, logical and readable account of the structure and dynamics of ABMs, some research groups also find it useful as a workflow for model design. Even so, there are still limitations to ODD that obstruct its more widespread adoption. Such limitations are discussed and addressed in this paper: the limited availability of guidance on how to use ODD; the length of ODD documents; limitations of ODD for highly complex models; lack of sufficient details of many ODDs to enable reimplementation without access to the model code; and the lack of provision for sections in the document structure covering model design ratio-nale, the model's underlying narrative, and the means by which the model's fitness for purpose is evaluated. We document the steps we have taken to provide better guidance on: structuring complex ODDs and an ODD summary for inclusion in a journal article (with full details in supplementary material; Table 1); using ODD to point readers to relevant sections of the model code; update the document structure to include sections on model rationale and evaluation. We also further advocate the need for standard descriptions of simulation experiments and argue that ODD can in principle be used for any type of simulation model. Thereby ODD would provide a lingua franca for simulation modelling.},

@article{Letschert2023,
abstract = {Worldwide, fisheries face the consequences of climate change and compete with expanding human activities at sea, which may trigger unforeseen reactions of fishers. Hence, knowledge on drivers of fishing behavior is crucial for management and needs to be integrated in resource management policies. In this study, we identify factors influencing fishing activity of North Sea demersal fleets. First, we explore drivers of the North Sea demersal fisheries in scientific literature. Subsequently, we study the effects of identified drivers on the spatio-temporal dynamics of German demersal fisheries using boosted regression trees (BRT), a supervised machine learning technique. An exploratory literature review revealed a lack of studies incorporating biophysical, economic and socio-cultural fishing drivers in a single quantitative analysis. Our BRT analysis contributed to filling this research gap and highlighted the importance of biophysical drivers such as temperature, salinity, and bathymetry for fishing behavior. Contrary to findings of previous studies, our empirical analysis identified quotas and market prices to be irrelevant, except for low brown shrimp prices, which counter-intuitively increased fishing effort. Moreover, economic and socio-cultural variables influencing brown shrimp fishing effort differed from the other fleets, especially determined by increased effort on workdays and reduced effort when fuel prices were high. Our findings provide key information for marine spatial planning and supports the integration of fishing fleet behavior into policies.},

@inbook{Döring2020,
abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of the small-scale fishing sector in Germany. The small-scale fleet is defined here as including vessels up to 24 m in length that are usually family owned and operate in the Baltic and North Seas. The fleet comprises of beam trawlers, cutter trawlers and vessels employing passive gears. Target species are brown shrimp and flatfish in the North Sea and herring, cod, flatfish and certain freshwater species in the Baltic Sea. Beam trawlers only fish in the coastal North Sea, whereas the small gill netters are based exclusively along the Baltic coast. The North and Baltic Seas have very different physical conditions. The North Sea has substantial tidal influence and normal marine salinity, while the Baltic Sea has minimal tidal influence and brackish water. After the introduction of the Common Fisheries Policy in 1983 (in East Germany 1990), individual quotas were issued. Most small-scale fishers are organised by producer organisations. They can be subject to additional conservation regulations which only apply to coastal zones. The increasing demand for fish stemming from fisheries which are certified as sustainable might impose further restrictions on small-scale fisheries. Most fishers employing passive gear have been in a steadily precarious economic situation due to very small quotas. Thus, their number is continuously decreasing. The shrimp and cutter fleets are in a healthier economic state, owing to their fishing of unregulated species (shrimp) or having the possibility to fish in both the Baltic and North Seas (cutter trawler fleet). Despite these advantages, investment in new vessels is extremely scarce in German small-scale fisheries.},

abstract = {Abstract Despite improved knowledge and stricter regulations, numerous fish stocks remain overharvested. Previous research has shown that fisheries management may fail when the models and assessments used to inform management are based on unrealistic assumptions regarding fishers' decision-making and responses to policies. Improving the understanding of fisher behaviour requires addressing its diversity and complexity through the integration of social science knowledge into modelling. In our paper, we review and synthesize state-of-the-art research on both social science's understanding of fisher behaviour and the representation of fisher decision-making in scientific models. We then develop and experiment with an agent-based social–ecological fisheries model that formalizes three different fishing styles. Thereby we reflect on the implications of our incorporation of behavioural diversity and contrast it with the predominant assumption in fishery models: fishing practices being driven by rational profit maximizing. We envision a next generation of fisheries models and management that account for social scientific knowledge on individual and collective human behaviours. Through our agent-based model, we demonstrate how such an integration is possible and propose a scientific approach for reducing uncertainty based on human behavioural diversity in fisheries. This study serves to lay the foundations for a next generation of social–ecological fishery models that account for human behavioural diversity and social and ecological complexity that are relevant for a realistic assessment and management of fishery sustainability problems.},

Alternative, dynamic models are described which are based on the data available for the Nova Scotia Groundfish Fisheries. It is shown that human responses can amplify relatively small annual environmental fluctuations, leading to large, quasi- cyclic changes in catch and profit. In a detailed spatial model it is shown that stochastic behaviour on the part of some fishermen is necessary for the survival of the fishery, and that the efficiency and size of the industry depends very much on the information flows concerning catch. A very general discussion is given which shows how these ideas are important in our understanding of innovation and discovery in general terms.}
