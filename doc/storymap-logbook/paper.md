# A fisher's personal account

Niels Feyndo is owner and captain of a small shrimper boat. His boat "Simona II" is anchored in the Northern German coastal town Büsum, alongside three other shrimper boats and another, larger, boat that catches plaice. The Simona II was built in 1972, has a length of 17.5 m and width of 5.2 m; its engine has 192 kW power and can propel the boat to 11.7 km/h in calm water.

Actually there is no captain Feyndo in Büsum, nor is there a boat called "Simona II", but she could be one of the virtual boats whose activities are simulated in our educational computer model "Viable North Sea". You can download this model and experience, even influence Niels' actions, in this interactive model simulation. Here's the outcome, as a commented log book, of such a simulation.

## The departure

```{.txt}
2021-12-27 11:00 8.85°E 54.13°N Leaving port Buesum
2021-12-27 11:10 8.76°E 54.14°N Arriving in open water
2021-12-27 11:10 8.76°E 54.14°N Searching for new fishing opportunities within 150 km
2021-12-27 16:10 8.54°E 54.66°N Found suitable location, ready to deploy gear
```

As most days, the Simona II is leaving the port, arrives in open water and scouts for fishing opportunities by considering bunkered fuel available, and steams to the suitable fishing location

## A single haul

```{.txt}
2021-12-27 16:10 8.54°E 54.66°N Found suitable straight-line fishing path in direction 236°N
2021-12-27 16:16 8.53°E 54.66°N Trawl filling with another 20.6 kg
2021-12-27 16:22 8.53°E 54.66°N Noting particularly good location (patch 261 66) catching 21 kg
2021-12-27 16:28 8.52°E 54.65°N Trawl filling with another 20.3 kg
2021-12-27 16:34 8.51°E 54.64°N Trawl filling with another 9.5 kg
2021-12-27 16:42 8.5°E 54.64°N Trawl filling with another 9.4 kg
2021-12-27 16:48 8.49°E 54.63°N Trawl filling with another 9.3 kg
2021-12-27 16:54 8.48°E 54.62°N Trawl filling with another 7.3 kg
2021-12-27 17:00 8.47°E 54.62°N Trawl filling with another 8.1 kg
2021-12-27 17:06 8.46°E 54.61°N Trawl filling with another 7.6 kg
2021-12-27 17:12 8.45°E 54.61°N Trawl filling with another 7.5 kg
2021-12-27 17:18 8.44°E 54.6°N Trawl filling with another 7.4 kg
2021-12-27 17:24 8.44°E 54.6°N Hauled 107 kg abord
```

Once at a suitable location, a straight path is laid on along which to trawl for the next hour. Every 6 minutes the weight change in the dragged net is recorded to monitor the catch. At 16:22 today, there was a particularly large increase of 21 kg within 6 minutes, so Niels marks this location to come back to at a later time.

## Zigzagging the sea

```

Niels zigzags back and forth between a southerly course and a northerly course with sligt variations. On each hourly haul, he yields almost 100 kg, and he continues to do so the entire night, completing 17 hauls on this trip.

```{.txt}
2021-12-28 9:10 8.53°E 54.66°N Hauled 114 kg abord
2021-12-28 10:0 8.76°E 54.14°N Arrived at port entry location
2021-12-28 15:10 8.85°E 54.13°N Arrived in  port Buesum
2021-12-28 16:0 8.85°E 54.13°N Landed  1416 kg Shrimp
```

After his last haul yielding 114 kg of shrimp, Niels decides to steer the Simona II back to the port of Buesum. He and his crew unload the cooked and frozen shrimp from this trip. They caught overall 1416 kg of shrimp! This shrimp is now ferried by truck to the sieving plant.

## Home and happy

```{.txt}
2021-12-28 16:0 8.85°E 54.13°N Sold fish for 7079 €
2021-12-28 16:0 8.85°E 54.13°N Consumed 1602 l diesel at 50 ct l-1,  costing 801 €
2021-12-28 16:0 8.85°E 54.13°N Paid 1460 € for wages
2021-12-28 16:0 8.85°E 54.13°N Made net gain 4818 €
2021-12-28 16:0 8.85°E 54.13°N Remember this fishing location (patch 256 64) with catch 30 kg
```

Niels balances the income and costs from the previous trip. The exceptionally good catch provided for 7079 € in gross income, from which Niels has to deduct the cost of diesel and the wages for his crew and himself. In the end, he made a gain of 4818 €, something that he rarely achieves, but a small sum only towards the estimated coast of about 800000 € he will have to invest in a new boat. If ever. Well, still he has to clean the boat and rest some before the next trip.

## Bad expectations

```{.txt}
2021-12-28 18:0 8.85°E 54.13°N Unloading for 2 hours finished
2021-12-28 18:0 8.85°E 54.13°N Need to rest 11 hours
2021-12-28 24:0 8.85°E 54.13°N Won't go out for expected bad catch
2021-12-29 24:0 8.85°E 54.13°N Won't go out for expected bad catch
2021-12-30 24:0 8.85°E 54.13°N Won't go out for expected bad catch
```

As on so many occasions in wintertime, the expectation for catching shrimp is low. It's best in October, but towards January it's a difficult time. So many days, the Simona II simply stays in the port. Three days later, Niels, however, makes another attempt:

## Failed attempts

```{.txt}
2021-12-31 11:0 8.85°E 54.13°N Leaves port Buesum
[..]
2021-01-01 8:0 7.65°E 54.63°N Hauled 8 kg abord
2021-01-01 16:2 8.85°E 54.13°N Arrived in  port Buesum
2021-01-01 17:1 8.85°E 54.13°N Landed  109 kg Shrimp
2021-01-01 17:1 8.85°E 54.13°N Sold fish for 547 €
2021-01-01 17:1 8.85°E 54.13°N Consumed 1668 l diesel at 50 ct l-1,  costing 834 €
2021-01-01 17:1 8.85°E 54.13°N Paid 1521 € for wages
2021-01-01 17:1 8.85°E 54.13°N Made net gain -1807 €
```

What a desaster! During this trip a haul only yielded up to 10 kg, and the boat came back to Büsum with only 109 kg of shrimp caught. The costs for the diesel and the wages far outweigh this trip's value. Niels faces a net loss of 1807 €, and decided not to go fishing until late February. It's just not worth it!

## Lucky again

```{.txt}
2022-02-23 5:0 8.85°E 54.13°N Landed  1 kg Shrimp
2022-03-03 9:1 8.85°E 54.13°N Landed  2 kg Shrimp
2022-03-05 10:1 8.85°E 54.13°N Landed  2 kg Shrimp
2022-03-10 12:1 8.85°E 54.13°N Landed  0 kg Shrimp
2022-03-12 16:1 8.85°E 54.13°N Landed  1755 kg Shrimp
2022-03-12 16:1 8.85°E 54.13°N Sold fish for 8773 €
2022-03-12 16:1 8.85°E 54.13°N Consumed 1635 l diesel at 50 ct l-1,  costing 817 €
2022-03-12 16:1 8.85°E 54.13°N Paid 1490 € for wages
2022-03-12 16:1 8.85°E 54.13°N Made net gain 6465 €
```

Niels makes several futile attempts to get back in business, but he is out of luck, even comes home with an empty net on the 10th of March. An alltime low, and the financial situation is looking bleak. Finally, on the 12th of March, Niels gets lucky again, and gains 6465 €.
