abstract = {A set of vertically stratified MOCNESS tows made on the southern flank of Georges Bank in spring 1981 and 1983 was analyzed to examine the relationship between larval cod and haddock feeding success and turbulent dissipation in a stratified water column. Observed feeding ratios (mean no. prey larval gut-1) for three size classes of larvae were compared with estimated ingestion rates using the Rothschild and Osborn (Journal of Plankton Research, 10, 1988, 465-74) predator-prey encounter rate model. Simulation of contact rates requires parameter estimates of larval fish and their prey cruising speeds, density of prey, and turbulent velocity of the water column. Turbulent dissipation was estimated from a formulation by James (Estuarine and Coastal Marine Science, 5, 1977, 339-353) incorporating both a wind and tidal component. Larval ingestion rates were based on swallowing probabilities derived from calm-water laboratory observations. Model-predicted turbulence profiles generally showed that dissipation rates were low to moderate (10-11-10-7 W kg-1). Turbulence was minimal at or below the pycnocline (≃25m) with higher values (1-2 orders of magnitude) near the surface due to wind mixing and at depth due to shear in the tidal current near bottom. In a stratified water column during the day, first-feeding larvae (5-6 mm) were located mostly within or above the pycnocline coincident with their copepod prey (nauplii and copepodites). The 7-8 mm larvae were most abundant within the pycnocline, whereas the 9-10 mm larvae were found within and below the pycnocline. Feeding ratios were relatively low in early morning following darkness when the wind speed was low, but increased by a factor of 2-13 by noon and evening when the wind speed doubled. Comparison of depth-specific feeding ratios with estimated ingestion rates, derived from turbulence-affected contact rates, generally were reasonable after allowing for an average gut evacuation time (4 h), and in many cases the observed and estimated values had similar profiles. However, differences in vertical profiles may be attributed to differential digestion time, pursuit behavior affected by high turbulence, vertical migration of the larger larvae, an optimum light level for feeding, smaller-scale prey patchiness, and the gross estimates of turbulence. Response-surface estimation of averaged feeding ratios as a function of averaged prey density (0-50 m) with a minimum water-column turbulence value predicted that 5-6 mm larvae have a maximum feeding response at the highest prey densities (>30 prey l-1) and lower turbulence estimates (<10-10 W kg-1). The 7-8 mm and 9-10 mm larvae also have a maximum feeding response at high prey densities and low turbulence, but it extends to lower prey densities (> 10 prey l-1) as turbulence increases to intermediate levels, clearly showing an interaction effect. In general, maximum feeding ratios occur at low to intermediate levels of turbulence where average prey density is greater than 10-20 prey l-1.},

abstract = {The factors regulating phytoplankton community composition play a crucial role in structuring aquatic food webs. However, consensus is still lacking about the mechanisms underlying the observed biogeographical differences in cell size composition of phytoplankton communities. Here we use a trait-based model to disentangle these mechanisms in two contrasting regions of the Atlantic Ocean. In our model, the phytoplankton community can self-assemble based on a trade-off emerging from relationships between cell size and (1) nutrient uptake, (2) zooplankton grazing, and (3) phytoplankton sinking. Grazing ∼ pushes(tm) the community towards larger cell sizes, whereas nutrient uptake and sinking ∼ pull(tm) the community towards smaller cell sizes. We find that the stable environmental conditions of the tropics strongly balance these forces leading to persistently small cell sizes and reduced size diversity. In contrast, the seasonality of the temperate region causes the community to regularly reorganize via shifts in species composition and to exhibit, on average, bigger cell sizes and higher size diversity than in the tropics. Our results raise the importance of environmental variability as a key structuring mechanism of plankton communities in the ocean and call for a reassessment of the current understanding of phytoplankton diversity patterns across latitudinal gradients.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the nature of the relationships between dimensions of governance in Open Source (OS) communities. A recent review highlighted this issue as critical. Furthermore, this issue has been recognized as strategic for managing the trade-off between innovation and standardization, the capacity of firms to profit from their investment in open source, and the sustainability of OS projects. Our results are based on a comparative analysis of 40 OS projects contained in the Freshmeat dataset. For each project, we collected data on the governance solutions implemented. Governance mechanisms have been ranked for their degree of openness. Our findings show that OS governance is configurational. Those configurations are defined along two dimensions: leadership and decision-making distribution, and reciprocity of the appropriability regime. Four configurations are indeed defined: open source, sponsored, reciprocity-based, and tolerant dictatorship. Those configurations have been defined based on an exploratory factor analysis.

Over the past five years, authors Dustin Boswell and Trevor Foucher have analyzed hundreds of examples of "bad code" (much of it their own) to determine why they're bad and how they could be improved. Their conclusion? You need to write code that minimizes the time it would take someone else to understand it—even if that someone else is you. This book focuses on basic principles and practical techniques you can apply every time you write code. Using easy-to-digest code examples from different languages, each chapter dives into a different aspect of coding, and demonstrates how you can make your code easy to understand. Simplify naming, commenting, and formatting with tips that apply to every line of code Refine your program's loops, logic, and variables to reduce complexity and confusion Attack problems at the function level, such as reorganizing blocks of code to do one task at a time Write effective test code that is thorough and concise—as well as readable "Being aware of how the code you create affects those who look at it later is an important part of developing software. The authors did a great job in taking you through the different aspects of this challenge, explaining the details with instructive examples." —Michael Hunger, passionate Software Developer},

@article{Lavaud2021a,
abstract = {Eastern oysters growing in deltaic Louisiana estuaries in the northern Gulf of Mexico must tolerate considerable salinity variation from natural climate variability (e.g., rainfall and stream run-off pushing isohalines offshore; tropical storms pushing isohalines inshore) and man-made diversions and siphons releasing freshwater from the Mississippi River. These salinity variations are predicted to increase with future climate change because of the increased frequency of stronger storms and also in response to proposed large-scale river diversions. Increased Mississippi River flow into coastal estuaries from river diversions, along with potential changes in rainfall and stream run-off from climate change will alter spatial and temporal salinity patterns. In this study we used an individual Dynamic Energy Budget model to predict growth and reproductive potential of eastern oysters across observed and simulated salinity gradients corresponding to different climate and river management scenarios. We used validated model outputs of salinity from a coupled hydrology-hydrodynamic model to assess the current impacts of Davis Pond diversion discharge on oysters located downstream. Under a high diversion discharge scenario oyster growth potential was reduced by 9%, 4%, and 1% in Upper, Mid, and Lower Bay locations, respectively, as compared to a limited discharge year. Reproductive outputs decreased by 34% and 2% in the Upper and Lower Bay locations, respectively, and increased by 2% at the Mid Bay site. In scenarios combining predicted increased temperature with the effect of diversions, all oysters located in the Upper and Mid Bay sites died due to severe summer conditions (high temperatures combined with low salinity). Overall, oysters in down-estuary locations, influenced by both estuarine river management and gulf conditions demonstrated significant tolerance to changing salinity and temperature conditions from diversions alone and when combined with climate change. In contrast, oysters located up-estuary, and exposed to more extreme salinity impacts from river management, demonstrated potentially lethal impacts through direct mortality, and reduced sustainability through decrease in reproductive output. These predictions at the individual level may translate into less sustainable populations in the most extreme scenarios; restoration and production plans may benefit from accounting for these impacts on reproductive output particularly as decision makers seek to restore critical oyster areas.},

In this model fishers behaviour is simulated based on optimal effort allocation.

Overall area closures have a negative impact on the profitability of the fleets. This would be worsened with higher fuel prices and decreased stock productivity.},

abstract = {We estimate the potential for cumulative impacts from multiple anthropogenic stressors on fish, sea birds, and marine mammals in the western, southern and south-eastern parts of marine waters around Greenland. The analysis is based on a comprehensive data set representing five human activities including two proxies for climate change, as well as 25 key animal species including commercially important fish and top predators such as sea birds and marine mammals. Anthropogenic stressors are concentrated in two areas: the offshore waters south of Greenland, and especially the western coast from the Qeqertarsuaq (Disko Island) area to the southern tip of Greenland. The latter is also an area of high importance for many key species, thus the potential for cumulative impacts is high along Greenland's west coast. We conclude that this area should be under high scientific scrutiny and conservation attention. Our study is a first attempt and a stepping-stone towards more detailed and accurate estimates of the effects of multiple human stressors on Arctic marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Monthly VMS and logbook data of the North Sea Brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) fleets of Denmark, Netherlands and Germany from 2009 to 2018 were analysed for trends and regional patterns in five subareas. Effort increased by 12% while landings decreased by 9% from the first five to the second five years of the time series. All areas showed a significant decreasing trend of LPUE in the fishery of the first quarter of the year from 2009 to 2018. Fishing effort in Dutch and East Frisian waters during winter was negatively correlated with LPUE in the same and adjacent areas in March – April. Furthermore, highly significant negative correlations were found between fishing effort in January and February in Dutch waters and LPUE in July and August in areas further north, explaining up to 86% of the variance. Together our results support the hypothesis that early recruitment in the Northern areas partially depends on a new cohort coming from the south and that reduced recruitment in Northern areas may be a consequence of previous local depletion of egg-bearing females further south. Egg bearing shrimp appear to concentrate in southern areas in January and February and migrate to adjacent northern areas for egg release in March and April. To prevent economic and ecological consequences for the shrimp stock and the fishery, transboundary management measures need to be considered and implemented. Further investigations of migration and drift patterns of brown shrimp are recommended.},

abstract = {On temperate rocky reefs, overexploitation of high-trophic-level omnivores can result in the decimation of kelp forest habitats by releasing sea urchin population networks from top-down control. However, the local dynamics of the resulting trophic cascades are context-dependent. Here, we investigate the community-wide patterns associated with both diffuse stressors and localized protection of high-trophic-level omnivores in kelp forest ecosystems by comparing communities among marine reserves and fished areas in two contrasting regions in terms of fishing intensity and land-based stressors, Fiordland and the Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand. We find higher densities of the potential sea urchin predators, red rock lobsters (Jasus edwardsii) and banded wrasse (Notolabrus fucicola), in the Fiordland region, and larger effect sizes of fishing on the exploited fish communities in the Marlborough Sounds. Patterns in sea urchin density were consistent with the idea that high-trophic-level species, such as large fish and rock lobsters, regulate sea urchin population density, with lower densities of Evechinus chloroticus observed inside marine reserves, in both regions. Nevertheless, densities of E. chloroticus were generally high (>3 m2) in the Marlborough Sounds, likely above a grazing threshold in both fished and reserve sites. The proportion of habitat where sea urchins were absent was 29% in Marlborough Sounds and 90% in Fiordland. Consequently, we observe 49% barren habitat in Fiordland vs. 70%, and a larger effect of fishing on kelp community structure, in the Marlborough Sounds, where fishing effect sizes and land-based stressors were more severe. We propose that a combination of diffuse stressors including regional overexploitation of important sea urchin predators, sedimentation, and warming of coastal waters likely contributed to regional differences in the responses of trophic interaction chains to localized reductions in fishing within marine reserves. The present study highlights how physiologically stressed and modified kelp forest ecosystems are more susceptible to detrimental phase shifts at a regional spatial scale.},

abstract = {The rate of exchange, or connectivity, among populations effects their ability to recover after disturbance events. However, there is limited information on the extent to which populations are connected or how multiple disturbances affect connectivity, especially in coastal and marine ecosystems. We used network analysis and the outputs of a biophysical model to measure potential functional connectivity and predict the impact of multiple disturbances on seagrasses in the central Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), Australia. The seagrass networks were densely connected, indicating that seagrasses are resilient to the random loss of meadows. Our analysis identified discrete meadows that are important sources of seagrass propagules and that serve as stepping stones connecting various different parts of the network. Several of these meadows were close to urban areas or ports and likely to be at risk from coastal development. Deep water meadows were highly connected to coastal meadows and may function as a refuge, but only for non-foundation species. We evaluated changes to the structure and functioning of the seagrass networks when one or more discrete meadows were removed due to multiple disturbance events. The scale of disturbance required to disconnect the seagrass networks into two or more components was on average >245 km, about half the length of the metapopulation. The densely connected seagrass meadows of the central GBRWHA are not limited by the supply of propagules; therefore, management should focus on improving environmental conditions that support natural seagrass recruitment and recovery processes. Our study provides a new framework for assessing the impact of global change on the connectivity and persistence of coastal and marine ecosystems. Without this knowledge, management actions, including coastal restoration, may prove unnecessary and be unsuccessful.},

abstract = {The brown shrimp Crangon crangon migrates into the brackish part of the Westerschelde estuary (southwest Netherlands) shortly after metamorphosis and uses the tidal marsh habitat as a nursery until reaching a total length of about 15 mm. The importance of the marsh as a nursery was evaluated by estimating foraging activity, predation mortality and residence time. In early postlarval stages, C. crangon utilised the intertidal creeks of an estuarine tidal marsh from early spring (March–April) until late autumn (October–November). Postlarval shrimp leaving the marsh with the ebb tide always had significantly more food in their stomachs than shrimp entering the marsh with the incoming flood water. Predation upon the shrimp population was relatively low during most months, but in increased between August and October when common gobies, Pomatoschistus microps, were present in high densities. There was also predation by the small seabass Dicentrarchus labrax. The marsh creeks function both as foraging areas and as predation refuge. Depending on temperature, postlarval shrimp stayed in the marsh for a period of two to three weeks. Quantitatively, the value of the marsh as a nursery area had changed drastically during a second year of sampling, illustrating high natural year-to-year variability. However, the seasonal pattern remained. Recruitment to the subtidal adult population represents an export of animals from the marsh to the estuary. This export is negligible in terms of biomass (as compared to the total biomass of the estuarine population) but it may be important in terms of numbers of individuals.},

abstract = {There is growing concern that modifications to the global environment such as ocean acidification and increased ultraviolet radiation may interact with anthropogenic pollutants to adversely affect the future marine environment. Despite this, little is known about the nature of the potential risks posed by such interactions. Here, we performed a multifactorial microcosm experiment to assess the impact of ocean acidification, ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation and oil hydrocarbon contamination on sediment chemistry, the microbial community (composition and function) and biochemical marker response of selected indicator species. We found that increased ocean acidification and oil contamination in the absence of UV-B will significantly alter bacterial composition by, among other things, greatly reducing the relative abundance of Desulfobacterales, known to be important oil hydrocarbon degraders. Along with changes in bacterial composition, we identified concomitant shifts in the composition of oil hydrocarbons in the sediment and an increase in oxidative stress effects on our indicator species. Interestingly, our study identifies UV-B as a critical component in the interaction between these factors, as its presence alleviates harmful effects caused by the combination of reduced pH and oil pollution. The model system used here shows that the interactive effect of reduced pH and oil contamination can adversely affect the structure and functioning of sediment benthic communities, with the potential to exacerbate the toxicity of oil hydrocarbons in marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Based on historical landings and landings-per-unit-effort data, fishing effort was estimated in the period of 1924-1938 in a study area representing the German exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the North Sea. Three main trawling fisheries were identified, i.e. the international flatfish fisheries comprising the effort of steam trawlers and motor cutters, the German shrimp fisheries and the industrial inshore fisheries. Except for shrimp trawling, which was performed by beam trawling with one beam per vessel, all historical trawling effort was identified as otter board trawling. The trawling effort increased from 1,131,000 to 1,232,000. h in 1924 to 3,170,000 to 3,836,000. h in 1937 and declined in 1938. The main fishery effort was contributed by the German shrimp fisheries, accounting for a maximum of 2,140,000. h in 1937. In comparison, in 2006, approximately 540,000. h were spent fishing in the trawl fisheries of the study area, comprising effort from small (≤221. kW) to large beam trawlers (>221. kW), shrimp fisheries and otter board trawling. The bulk of the historical effort was concentrated at water depths of 5-20. m. With the implementation of combustion engines and new gear technology, the period of 1924-1938 marked a new era for marine fishing when virtually all space became accessible and, in particular, the trawling of inshore areas increased. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The fishery is exploited by beam trawlers often using codends with very small mesh sizes, leading to concerns about catch rates of undersized shrimp. However, little information is available on codend size selection, making it difficult to provide scientifically based advice on alternative codend designs. Therefore, this study establishes a predictive framework for codend size selection of brown shrimp, based on a large selectivity dataset from 33 different codend designs tested during four experimental fishing cruises, during which more than 350,000 brown shrimp were length measured. Predictions by the framework confirm concerns about the exploitation pattern in the fishery, because the retention probability of undersized shrimp reaches 95% with the currently applied designs. The framework predictions allow the exploration of obtainable exploitation patterns depending on codend design. For example, increasing codend mesh size to 25–29 mm would reduce the retention rate of undersized shrimp to a maximum of 50%, depending on codend mesh type.},

abstract = {A simulation model of the life cycle of Crangon crangon tracking daily cohorts from the egg stage to the adult stage was programmed in R taking into account size-specific, seasonally varying natural mortality rates of all life stages, temperature-dependent development rates of eggs and larvae, juvenile and adult growth rates as a function of temperature and size, sex, maturation, egg production, and seasonally varying size-specific fishing mortalities. The observed seasonal patterns of commercial catch and egg production could only be reproduced with fast growth rates, which linked winter egg production with the subsequent juvenile recruitment in May-June, the commercial catch peak in September and the peak in egg production over the following winter. Likewise, substantially lowered natural mortalities in winter are essential to generate seasonal patterns similar to the observed ones. The seasonal pattern of egg production can only be reproduced with a minimum spawning age. Cohorts from summer eggs rapidly follow the earlier winter egg cohorts, forming an annual joint wave of growing shrimp. The summer egg cohort originates from summer eggs of the previous year and, depending on winter and spring mortality levels, also from large individuals of the preceding winter egg cohort. The model represents a new tool to investigate maximum yield per recruit in this species as a function of seasonal effort levels, mesh sizes and seasonal closures under different predation and temperature scenarios.},

abstract = {Although plant photosynthetic capacity as determined by the maximum carboxylation rate (i.e., Vc,max25) and the maximum electron transport rate (i.e., Jmax25) at a reference temperature (generally 25 °C) is known to vary considerably in space and time in response to environmental conditions, it is typically parameterized in Earth system models (ESMs) with tabulated values associated with plant functional types. In this study, we have developed a mechanistic model of leaf utilization of nitrogen for assimilation (LUNA) to predict photosynthetic capacity at the global scale under different environmental conditions. We adopt an optimality hypothesis to nitrogen allocation among light capture, electron transport, carboxylation and respiration. The LUNA model is able to reasonably capture the measured spatial and temporal patterns of photosynthetic capacity as it explains ∼55% of the global variation in observed values of Vc,max25 and ∼65% of the variation in the observed values of Jmax25. Model simulations with LUNA under current and future climate conditions demonstrate that modeled values of Vc,max25 are most affected in high-latitude regions under future climates. ESMs that relate the values of Vc,max25 or Jmax25 to plant functional types only are likely to substantially overestimate future global photosynthesis.},

abstract = {Construction of large dams often wreaks havoc on coastal marine systems through hydro-biological alterations. In this study, we have investigated how salinity changes in the northwestern Arabian Gulf (NWAG) due to water regulation activities upstream of the Shatt Al-Arab River system (SAR) has influenced the hydrography and microzooplankton (tintinnid ciliates) community in the semi-arid shallow marine environment off Kuwait. Microzooplankton and water samples for environmental variables were obtained between 2004 and 2008 across several coastal and offshore locations (n = 436). Microzooplankton samples showed the presence of sixty-two species of tintinnids belonging to sixteen genera and ten families. Hydrography data revealed a continuous decrease in salinity in the NWAG from 2004 until 2006 (mean salinity: 37.3; CV: 0.09), and an increase thereafter (mean salinity in 2007–2008: 39.9, CV: 0.08). The minimum increase was reported in the offshore waters (0.50), and maximum in the northern areas upstream of Boubiyan Island ($\sim$6). These changes associated with shifts in freshwater discharge from the SAR have adversely affected the hydrographical properties and phytoplankton stock post-2006. The seasonality (and heterogeneity) in hydrography were more pronounced in the low saline period of 2004–2006 than 2007–2008. As evident from multivariate statistical analyses, these changes have generated undesirable effects on the structural property indicators (abundance, biomass, and diversity), and distribution patterns of tintinnids in 2007–2008. Although agglutinated loricates constituted the most dominant group in the 2004–2008 period, the hydrographical changes post-2006 increased the relative abundance of hyalinated loricates. The biotic-abiotic interactions and distance-based linear models (DistLM) revealed that among the measured environmental variables, the cumulative effect of salinity, water temperature, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, silicic acid, and Chl a played a key role regulating microzooplankton community in 2004–2006 ($\rho$ = 0.633, P: 0.1%), while a combination of factors silicic acid, salinity, water temperature, and Chl a ($\rho$= 0.422, P: 0.1%) were more important in 2007–2008. All together, species distribution patterns and co mplementary evidence from biotic-abiotic interactions suggest that the salinity increase post-2006 caused a significant shift in tintinnid community properties with possible repercussions on the functioning of pelagic food-web in the coastal and offshore waters of the NWAG. The present study thus offers prima facie evidence of changes in microbial grazer communities caused by anthropogenic alterations of river discharge into the Arabian Gulf in general and NWAG in particular.},

abstract = {The Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus), native to estuarine areas of the Atlantic coast of the United States, has become a valuable ecotoxicological model as a result of its ability to acclimate to rapid environmental changes and adapt to polluted habitats. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved small RNAs that regulate gene expression and play critical roles in stress responses in a variety of organisms. Global miRNA expression in killifish and the potential roles miRNA have in environmental acclimation have yet to be characterized. Accordingly, we profiled miRNA expression in killifish gill for the first time and identified a small group of highly expressed, well-conserved miRNAs as well as 16 novel miRNAs not yet identified in other organisms. Killifish respond to large fluctuations in salinity with rapid changes in gene expression and protein trafficking to maintain osmotic balance, followed by a secondary phase of gene and protein expression changes that enable remodeling of the gills. Arsenic, a major environmental toxicant, was previously shown to inhibit gene expression responses in killifish gill, as well the ability of killifish to acclimate to a rapid increase in salinity. Thus, we examined the individual and combined effects of salinity and arsenic on miRNA expression in killifish gill. Using small RNA sequencing, we identified 270 miRNAs expressed in killifish, and found that miR-135b was differentially expressed in response to arsenic and at 24 h following transfer to salt water. Predicted targets of miR-135b are involved in ion transport, cell motility and migration, GTPase mediated signal transduction and organelle assembly. Consistent with previous studies of these two environmental stressors, we found a significant interaction (i.e., arsenic dependent salinity effect), whereby killifish exposed to arsenic exhibited an opposite response in miR-135b expression at 24 h post hyperosmotic challenge compared to controls. By examining mRNA expression of predicted miRNA targets during salinity acclimation and arsenic exposure, we found that miR-135b targets were significantly more likely to decrease during salinity acclimation than non-targets. Our identification of a significant interaction effect of arsenic and salinity on miR-135b expression supports the hypothesis that arsenic alters upstream regulators of stress response networks, which may adversely affect the killifish response to osmotic stress. The characterization of miRNAs in this ecotoxicological model will be a valuable resource for future studies investigating the role of miRNAs in response to environmental stress.},

abstract = {Pile foundations are used to support both vertical and horizontal loads in many geotechnical projects, such as the coastal and offshore engineering. The responses of piles under vertical-horizontal combined loading are separately analyzed and then superposed in current design practice. This simplified analysis approach does not take the coupling effect of the combined loads into consideration. The research on this topic is limited and the results reported to date are inconclusive with regard to the influence of vertical loads on the horizontal response of piles. In this paper, a series of centrifuge model tests under different vertical-horizontal combined loading conditions was performed to investigate the influence rules and mechanism of the combined loads on the response of piles in sand. The vertical load is shown to densify the soil near the pile and therefore decrease the horizontal displacement and bending moment of the pile: this is termed the “soil densification effect”. The vertical load induces an additional bending moment of the pile due to the lateral deformation of the pile: this is termed the “P-$\Delta$ effect”. The soil densification effect plays a dominant role in the early horizontal loading while the P-$\Delta$ effect is strengthened as the horizontal loads increases. These compound effect of these two seemingly opposing effects is a decrease in the bending moment of the pile decrease first then increase as the horizontal load increases. Additional settlement of the pile is caused by horizontal loading and isa positively correlated with the pre-vertical loads.},

abstract = {A recent increase in the construction of Offshore Wind Farms (OWFs) has initiated numerous environmental impact assessments and monitoring programs. These focus on sea mammals, seabirds, benthos or demersal fish, but generally ignore any potential effects OWFs may have on the pelagic ecosystem. The only work on the latter has been through modelling analyses, which predict localised impacts like enhanced vertical mixing leading to a decrease in seasonal stratification, as well as shelf-wide changes of tidal amplitudes. Here we provide for the first-time empirical bio-physical data from an OWF. The data were obtained by towing a remotely operated vehicle (TRIAXUS ROTV) through two non-operating OWFs in the summer stratified North Sea. The undulating TRIAXUS transects provided high-resolution CTD data accompanied by oxygen and chlorophyll-a measurements. We provide empirical indication that vertical mixing is increased within the OWFs, leading to a doming of the thermocline and a subsequent transport of nutrients into the surface mixed layer (SML). Nutrients were taken up rapidly because underwater photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) enabled net primary production in the entire water column, especially within submesoscale chlorophyll-a pillars that were observed at regular intervals within the OWF regions. Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) images revealed distinct meroplankton distribution patterns in a copepod-dominated plankton community. Hydroacoustic records did not show any OWF effects on the distribution of pelagic fish. The results of a pre-OWF survey show however, that it is difficult to fully separate the anthropogenic impacts from the natural variability.},

We model the system as a Multi-Agent System using both Cellular Automata Model (CAM) and Agent-Based Model (ABM) computational modelling approaches. CAM are used to describe the environment and the dynamics of resources. ABM are used to describe the behaviour of fishing activities. The main interest of the conceptual model lies in the proposed laws and in its capacity to organize hierarchically all the local interactions and transition rules within the simulated entities. We report preliminary results showing that our modelling approach facilitates software parameterization for the specific requirements implied by the context of a small-scale fishery. The main results of this work consist in the creation of a computer modelling structure CAM and ABM, which constitutes a preliminary for an optimized resources management.

abstract = {Models of socio-environmental or social-ecological systems (SES) commonly address problems requiring interdisciplinary scientific expertise and input from a heterogeneous group of stakeholders. In SES modelling multiple interactions occur on different scales among various phenomena. These scale phenomena include the technical, such as system variables, process detail, inputs and outputs, which most often require spatial, temporal, thematic and organisational choices. From a good practice and project efficiency perspective, the problem scoping and conceptual model formulation phase of modelling is the one to address well from the outset. During this phase, intense and substantive discussions should arise regarding appropriate scales at which to represent the different phenomena. Although the details of these discussions influence the path of model development, they are seldom documented and as a result often forgotten. We draw upon personal experience with existing protocols and communications in recent literature to propose preliminary guidelines for documenting these early discussions about the scale(s) of the studied phenomena. Our guidelines aim to aid modelling group members in building and capturing the richness of their rationale for scoping and scale decisions. The resulting transcripts are intended to promote transparency of modelling decisions and provide essential support for the justification of the final model for its intended use. They also facilitate adaptive modifications of the pathway of model development via retracing decisions and iterative reflection upon alternative scale options.},

Here we synthesized 171 studies that manipulated two or more stressors in marine and coastal systems and found that cumulative effects in individual studies were additive (26%), synergistic (36%), and antagonistic (38%). The overall interaction effect across all studies was synergistic, but interaction type varied by response level (community: antagonistic, population: synergistic), trophic level (autotrophs: antagonistic, heterotrophs: synergistic), and specific stressor pair (seven pairs additive, three pairs each synergistic and antagonistic). Addition of a third stressor changed interaction effects significantly in two-thirds of all cases and doubled the number of synergistic interactions. Given that most studies were performed in laboratories where stressor effects can be carefully isolated, these three-stressor results suggest that synergies may be quite common in nature where more than two stressors almost always coexist.

The question is raised whether an uncontrolled fishery is sustainable or the conceivable ecological stress results in recruitment overfishing. The time series of shrimp abundance, commercial landings per unit of effort and the shrimp consumption by cod and whiting provide a perspective for nature conservation and fishery management. The results indicate that predation mortality by only two of the predator species present in the coastal areas exceeds the landings by a factor 2 to 20, and that, despite large annual fluctuations in shrimp consumption, the shrimp stock has remained remarkably stable over 30 years. Moreover, predators exploit juvenile shrimp, while the fishery exploits adult shrimp after the predators have levied their toll. The international catch of approx. 26,000 tonnes is of the same order of magnitude as the consumption of one natural predator. Thus, there is no indication that the shrimp stock is fished at unsustainable levels.},

Small brown shrimps were characterized by LPUE values increasing early in the year in shallow waters, especially in estuaries in July. Subsequently, peak LPUE values are reached at the end of September in all depths, but with variable spatial patterns between years. LPUE data indicate a general outward migration between early summer and winter. In winter, large shrimp shows a clear increase in LPUE with depths mainly in regions adjacent to the Dutch coast and a reversed pattern close to the Danish coast. The large size class in winter-which consists mainly of mature or egg-bearing females-showed high LPUE values along two persistent diagonal bands in the German Bight.

abstract = {Benthic oxygen fluxes consist mostly of advective and diffusive terms. Both terms in the German Bight exhibit a prominent annual cycle but with opposite variation patterns. To understand the driving mechanisms quantitatively, a novel 3-D benthic-pelagic coupled model resolving interactions among macrobenthos, bioturbation, oxygen consumption, and carbon early diagenesis was applied to reconstruct the benthic states. Simulation results show a satisfactory agreement with field data and reveal that the benthic oxygen flux is determined by not only pelagic drivers but also by internal dynamics associated with the interaction between organic carbon and macrobenthos, and bedform morphodynamics. Variation of advective flux, characterized by summer-low and winter-high, is mainly driven by hydrodynamics and bedform morphodynamics, while variation of diffusive flux, featured by summer-high and winter-low, is a compound effect of pelagic and benthic drivers with a dominant control by macrobenthos through bioturbation. The role of bioturbation in benthic oxygen consumption is twofold: (a) on the one hand, it alters the particulate organic carbon (POC) distribution in surface sediments, thereby changing the availability of POC to oxygen consumption; (b) on the other hand, it mixes oxygen down into sediments, thereby facilitating oxygen consumption. Our results indicate that the first role prevails in sandy seafloor characterized by energetic hydrodynamics, while the second role becomes increasingly important along with a weakening of bottom currents. We found that bioturbation contributes up to 87% (Formula presented.) 4% and 55% (Formula presented.) 8% of the total benthic oxygen fluxes in muddy seabed and at a regional scale (the German Bight), respectively.},

abstract = {In many coastal areas, natural habitats are being fragmented and lost to encroaching human development. These landscape changes can affect the production of recreationally and commercially important fisheries because many exploited species of fish and shellfish are estuarine dependent and utilize coastal marshes as nursery grounds. Brown shrimp are an example of a commercially exploited species that may be highly affected by changes in the spatial distribution of habitat types. We used a spatially explicit, individual-based simulation model to explore the role of marsh vegetation and edge habitat in brown shrimp survival. The model simulated shrimp movement, mortality, and growth of individual shrimp from arrival as postlarvae to 70-mm body length, when they emigrate offshore. Simulations were performed on 100 x 100 m spatial grid of l-m2 cells, with each cell labeled as "water" or "vegetation". Predation mortality was influenced by shrimp size, movement, and habitat. Simulated shrimp growth depended on temperature, habitat, and local shrimp density. We examined the relationships between shrimp survival and marsh attributes (amount of vegetation and edge habitat) by simulating a series of four habitat maps that we created from aerial photographs. Biological parameters were derived from published estimates and from field data. We corroborated the model by comparing the simulated shrimp abundance with summary statistics from long-term monitoring data, by comparing the simulated density with fine-scale patterns observed in field studies, and by comparing simulated and measured stable-isotope values. Surviving shrimp grew faster, moved less, spent more time in vegetation, and experienced slightly higher local densities than shrimp that died during the simulation. Habitat maps with more edge habitat invariably produced higher simulated shrimp survival rates. High-edge habitats increased survival by providing shrimp more direct access to vegetation without additional movement-related mortality and density-dependent growth costs associated with low-edge habitats. Model predictions were robust to higher numbers of initial postlarvae and to alterations to the movement rules. The results of this study suggest that the management of brown shrimp should be extended from protecting the spawning stock through catch regulations to also protecting the estuarine life stages through habitat conservation and restoration.},

abstract = {It is expected that climate change will have significant impacts on ecosystems. Most model projections agree that the ocean will experience stronger stratification and less nutrient supply from deep waters. These changes will likely affect marine phytoplankton communities and will thus impact on the higher trophic levels of the oceanic food web. The potential consequences of future climate change on marine microbial communities can be investigated and predicted only with the help of mathematical models. Here we present the application of a model that describes aggregate properties of marine phytoplankton communities and captures the effects of a changing environment on their composition and adaptive capacity. Specifically, the model describes the phytoplankton community in terms of total biomass, mean cell size, and functional diversity. The model is applied to two contrasting regions of the Atlantic Ocean (tropical and temperate) and is tested under two emission scenarios: SRES A2 or "business as usual" and SRES B1 or "local utopia." We find that all three macroecological properties will decline during the next century in both regions, although this effect will be more pronounced in the temperate region. Being consistent with previous model predictions, our results show that a simple trait-based modeling framework represents a valuable tool for investigating how phytoplankton communities may reorganize under a changing climate.},

abstract = {Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complementary to this, many scientists have called for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired ‘inference at a glance' nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These “raincloud plots” can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper, we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab ( https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots).

abstract = {There is a growing recognition that adaptation to climate change requires an understanding of social processes that unfold across extended temporal trajectories. Yet, despite a move to reconceptualise adaptation as ‘pathways of change and response' with a deeper temporal dimension, the past generally remains poorly integrated into adaptation studies. This is related to a disavowal of environmental determinism within the academic field of history, which has caused the past to be addressed from other disciplinary perspectives within climate change literature, leading to accusations of over-simplification and neo-determinism. Conversely, whilst a relatively small amount of research within the subdiscipline of historical climatology has engaged with theories from mainstream adaptation to understand societies in the past, there has been little influence in the other direction. Building on a comprehensive review and critique of existing approaches to historical climate-society research, we argue for three important areas where historians should engage with climate change adaptation. The first area we call particularizing adaptation; this is the development of long-term empirical studies that uncover societal relations to climate in a particular place – including climate's cultural dimensions – which can provide a baseline and contextualisation for climate change adaptation options. The second, institutional path dependency and memory, argues for a focus on the evolution of formal institutions with a responsibility for adaptation, to understand how historical events and decisions inform and constrain practices today. Our third argument is for an appreciation of the history of ideas and concepts that underpin climate change adaptation. We call for a second-order observation – observation of the observers – within climate change research, to ensure that adaptation does not perpetuate historically-grown power structures.},

abstract = {Models are increasingly being relied upon to inform and support natural resource management. They are incorporating an ever broader range of disciplines and now often confront people without strong quantitative or model-building backgrounds. These trends imply a need for wider awareness of what constitutes good model-development practice, including reporting of models to users and sceptical review of models by users. To this end the paper outlines ten basic steps of good, disciplined model practice. The aim is to develop purposeful, credible models from data and prior knowledge, in consort with end-users, with every stage open to critical review and revision. Best practice entails identifying clearly the clients and objectives of the modelling exercise; documenting the nature (quantity, quality, limitations) of the data used to construct and test the model; providing a strong rationale for the choice of model family and features (encompassing review of alternative approaches); justifying the techniques used to calibrate the model; serious analysis, testing and discussion of model performance; and making a resultant statement of model assumptions, utility, accuracy, limitations, and scope for improvement. In natural resource management applications, these steps will be a learning process, even a partnership, between model developers, clients and other interested parties. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The intensive development of the Yellow River Delta has caused huge transportation of non-point pollutants into the Bohai Sea through source river estuaries and thus poses a considerable threat to eco-environmental security in the region. Long-term irrigation in the Yellow River basin, with occasional heavy rainfall and the related effects of ensuring hydrological processes and human activities in terms of nitrate N transport via surface water systems, is unclear. Using stable isotope ($\delta$2H-H2O and $\delta$18O-H2O, $\delta$15N-NO3− and $\delta$18O-NO3−) and auxiliary geographic data, the ISO source model was run to quantitatively analyze the supply relationship of river systems and the rapid change in the spatial pattern of nitrate N due to heavy rainfall in the estuarine delta. This analysis made clear the dominant contribution of agricultural activities and urbanization to NO3−-N emission, on which basis refined management measures were proposed to deal with NO3− in surface water from the “source-process”. The results of the study show that: (1) The relationship of surface water replenishment in the Yellow River Delta was affected not only by rainfall, irrigation, and other water conservancy measures but also the proportion of water from Yellow River flow declined from the source to estuary; (2) To a certain extent, rainfall diluted the concentration of nitrate N in the river and increased instantaneous flux of nitrate N into the sea, where nitrate N flux continuously increased from upstream to downstream; (3) The rapid deposition of nitrate in the estuary delta was driven by heavy rainfall and human activities such as excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers, rapid urbanization, and livestock waste discharge, and; (4) Scientific measures were needed to realize the interactive effect of the output of non-point source pollutants and the carrying and absorption capacity of coastal fragile ecosystems of the exogenous inputs.},

While the separate effects of warming and eutrophication on seagrasses are relatively well known, their joint effects remain largely unstudied. In order to fill this gap, and using Cymodocea nodosa as a model species, we assessed the joint effects of warming (three temperatures, 20 °C, 30 °C and 35 °C) with two potential outcomes of eutrophication: (i) increase in nutrients concentration in the water column (30 and 300 $\mu$M), and (ii) organic enrichment in the sediment). Our results confirm that temperature in isolation clearly affects plant performance; while plants exposed to 30 °C performed better than control plants, plants exposed to 35 °C showed clear symptoms of deterioration (e.g. decline of photosynthetic capacity, increase of incidence of necrotic tissue). Plants were unaffected by high ammonium concentrations; however, organic enrichment of sediment had deleterious effects on plant function (photosynthesis, growth, demographic balance). Interestingly, these negative effects were exacerbated by increased temperature. Our findings indicate that in addition to the possibility of the persistence of C. nodosa being directly jeopardized by temperature increase, the joint effects of warming and eutrophication may further curtail its survival. This should be taken into consideration in both predictions of climate change consequences and in local planning.},

abstract = {This work focuses on sediments of a shallow water lagoon, located in a densely populated area undergoing multiple stressors, with the goal of increasing the understanding of the links between diagenetic processes occurring in sediments, the dynamics of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water column, and potential consequences of hypoxia. Sediment data were collected over three consecutive years, from 2015 to 2017, during spring–summer, at five stations. Measured variables included: sediment porosity, grain size and organic carbon content, porewater microprofiles of O2, pH and H2S, porewater profiles of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA), NH4+, NO3–, dissolved Fe, and SO42–. In addition, long-term time series of oxygen saturations in the water column (years 2005–2017) were utilized in order to identify the occurrence and duration of hypoxic periods. The results show that the median DO saturation value in summer months was below 50% (around 110 $\mu$mol L–1), and that saturation values below 25% (below the hypoxic threshold) can persist for more than 1 week. Sediment stations can be divided in two groups based on their diagenetic intensity: intense and moderate. At these two groups of stations, the average DIC net production rates, estimated trough a steady-state model (Profile) were, respectively, of 2.8 and 1.0 mmol m–2 d–1, SO42– consumption rates were respectively 1.6 and 0.4 mmol m–2 d–1, while diffusive oxygen uptake fluxes, calculated from the sediment microprofile data, were of 28.5 and 17.5 mmol m–2 d–1. At the stations characterized by intense diagenesis, total dissolved sulfide accumulated in porewaters close to the sediment-water interface, reaching values of 0.7 mM at 10 cm. Considering the typical physico-chemical summer conditions, the theoretical time required to consume oxygen down to the hypoxic level by sediment oxygen demand ranges between 5 and 18 days, in absence of mixing and re-oxygenation. This estimation highlights that sediment diagenesis may play a crucial role in triggering and maintaining hypoxia of lagoon waters during the summer season in specific high intensity diagenesis zones. This role of the sediment could be enhanced by changes in regional climate conditions, such as the increase in frequency of summer heat waves.},

abstract = {We define corporate open source (COS) as applying the precepts and methodologies prevalent in the open source development community for creating industrial-strength software projects in a corporation for internal use. It may seem that open source style development-using informal processes, voluntary assignment to tasks, and having few financial incentives-may not be a good match for commercial environments. Our ongoing work, however, demonstrates that under the right circumstances, corporations can benefit from open source development techniques. We present two approaches to managing COS projects, and expand in detail on one of them. Our results indicate that open source approaches require significant adaptation to succeed in commercial settings. In particular, they require substantial support from business divisions within a corporation to successfully leverage the shared asset. Our ongoing research has attempted to determine whether corporations can effectively leverage the open source development model to create and manage software projects inside the corporate domain. We have observed how the precepts and methodologies of the open source development had to be adapted in order to create commercial grade software. In particular changes are required in order to accommodate a market-driven schedule and feature decisions that are not wholly amenable to an open source development approach. Our contributions in this article include describing two methods to effectively manage COS assets: an Infrastructure-based COS model, and a Project-specific COS model. We report experiences with the management aspects of the latter COS model, which includes our findings that this model requires a greater amount of support to get a new business division onboard when compared to the minimal support provided by traditional open source projects. However, the benefits of Project-specific COS outweigh the costs once the business division is fully on-board: the development costs are amortized over the number of divisions using the common asset, and the asset itself benefits from contributions from the expanded use. {\textcopyright} 2010 ACM.},

Additionally, viral infections that cause serious damage to shrimp populations have been observed in these environments. The present study sought to evaluate the immunotoxic effects of phenanthrene (Phe), a pollutant detected in coastal environments, on kuruma shrimp (Penaeus japonicus). We further examined the survival of shrimp following combined exposure to Phe (30 or 300 $\mu$g/L) and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Results show that exposure to Phe for seven days decreased immune system-related parameters, including total hemocyte count and phenoloxidase activity in hemolymph (p < 0.05). However, these effects were not detected after three days of exposure. Moreover, a combined exposure assay revealed that shrimp mortality increased following exposure to 300 $\mu$g/L Phe and infection with WSSV. The number of WSSV gene copies was also observed to increase in these co-exposed shrimp. Taken together, these results indicate that long-term Phe exposure impairs the immune system of P. japonicus, resulting in fatal proliferation of WSSV. Hence, considering that combined exposure to Phe and WSSV leads to increased mortality of shrimp, it is imperative that the detrimental effects elicited by multiple stresses be considered, and controlled, in areas inhabited by kuruma shrimp.},

abstract = {Losses at every stage in the food system influence the extent to which nutritional requirements of a growing global population can be sustainably met. Inefficiencies and losses in agricultural production and consumer behaviour all play a role. This paper aims to understand better the magnitude of different losses and to provide insights into how these influence overall food system efficiency. We take a systems view from primary production of agricultural biomass through to human food requirements and consumption. Quantities and losses over ten stages are calculated and compared in terms of dry mass, wet mass, protein and energy. The comparison reveals significant differences between these measurements, and the potential for wet mass figures used in previous studies to be misleading. The results suggest that due to cumulative losses, the proportion of global agricultural dry biomass consumed as food is just 6% (9.0% for energy and 7.6% for protein), and 24.8% of harvest biomass (31.9% for energy and 27.8% for protein). The highest rates of loss are associated with livestock production, although the largest absolute losses of biomass occur prior to harvest. Losses of harvested crops were also found to be substantial, with 44.0% of crop dry matter (36.9% of energy and 50.1% of protein) lost prior to human consumption. If human over-consumption, defined as food consumption in excess of nutritional requirements, is included as an additional inefficiency, 48.4% of harvested crops were found to be lost (53.2% of energy and 42.3% of protein). Over-eating was found to be at least as large a contributor to food system losses as consumer food waste. The findings suggest that influencing consumer behaviour, e.g. to eat less animal products, or to reduce per capita consumption closer to nutrient requirements, offer substantial potential to improve food security for the rising global population in a sustainable manner.},

An analytical model is to be regarded not as an assertion, but as a predicate within a larger logical structure of reasoning. Analogical models, such as databases, act as run-time surrogates for some parts of the problem world; in their design the properties of the model itself must be carefully distinguished from those of its subject.

abstract = {Governing human-environmental ecosystems is a complex problem. Rule-based fisheries models are faced with several challenges. First, for large geographical problems like oceans, they require considerable time to find satisfactory solutions. Second, they tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory. Behavioural assumptions directly impact fishers' capacity for adaptation and behaviour, which influences possible management strategies. To capture style and speed of adaptation to changes in the environment, coupled human-environment models must progress toward cognitively and socio-culturally realistic representations of fisher decision-making. In this paper, we implement the erotetic decision-making model in the POSEIDON fisheries model. The agents replicate observed behaviours such as fishing the line of a Marine Protected Area, using Individually Tradable Quotas, and returning to favoured fishing locations, and learning to break rules given harsh constraints. This provides a principled proof that reasons-based cognitive structures allow for anticipatory behavioural adaptation rather than reactive behavioural adaptation.},

abstract = {Electricity from wind energy is a major contributor to the strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use and thus reduce the negative impacts of climate change. Wind energy, like all power sources, can have adverse impacts on wildlife. After nearly 25 years of focused research, these impacts are much better understood, although uncertainty remains. In this report, we summarize positive impacts of replacing fossil fuels with wind energy, while describing what we have learned and what remains uncertain about negative ecological impacts of the construction and operation of land-based and offshore wind energy on wildlife and wildlife habitat in the U.S. Finally, we propose research on ways to minimize these impacts. TO SUMMARIZE: 1 Environmental and other benefits of wind energy include near-zero greenhouse gas emissions, reductions of other common air pollutants, and little or no water use associated with producing electricity from wind energy. Various scenarios for meeting U.S. carbon emission reduction goals indicate that a four-to five-fold expansion of land-based wind energy from the current 97 gigawatts (GW) by the year 2050 is needed to minimize temperature increases and reduce the risk of climate change to people and wildlife. 2 Collision fatalities of birds and bats are the most visible and measurable impacts of wind energy production. Current estimates suggest most bird species, especially songbirds, are at low risk of population-level impacts. Raptors as a group appear more vulnerable to collisions. Population-level impacts on migratory tree bats are a concern, and better information on population sizes is needed to evaluate potential impacts to these species. Although recorded fatalities of cave-dwelling bat species are typically low at most wind energy facilities, additional mortality from collisions is a concern given major declines in these species due to white-nose syndrome (WNS). Assessments of regional and cumulative fatality impacts for birds and bats have been hampered by the lack of data from areas with a high proportion of the nation's installed wind energy capacity. Efforts to expand data accessibility from all regions are underway, and this greater access to data along with improvements in statistical estimators should lead to improved impact assessments. 3 Habitat impacts of wind energy development are difficult to assess. An individual wind energy facility may encompass thousands of acres, but only a small percentage of the landscape within the project area is directly transformed. If a project is sited in previously undisturbed habitat, there is concern for indirect impacts, such as displacement of sensitive species. Studies to date indicate displacement of some species, but the long-term population impacts are unknown. 4 Offshore wind energy development in the U.S. is just beginning. Studies at offshore wind facilities in Europe indicate some bird and marine mammal species are displaced from project areas, but substantial uncertainty exists regarding the individual or population-level impacts of this displacement. Bird and bat collisions with offshore turbines are thought to be less common than at terrestrial facilities, but currently the tools to measure fatalities at offshore wind energy facilities are not available. The wind energy industry, state and federal agencies, conservation groups, academia, and scientific organizations have collaborated for nearly 25 years to conduct the research needed to improve our understanding of risk to wildlife and to avoid and minimize that risk. Efforts to reduce the uncertainty about wildlife risk must keep up with the pace and scale of the need to reduce carbon emissions. This will require focusing our research priorities and increasing the rate at which we incorporate research results into the development and validation of best practices for siting and operating wind energy facilities. We recommend continued focus on (1) species of regulatory concern or those where known or suspected population-level concern exists but corroborating data are needed, (2) research improving risk evaluation and siting to avoid impacts on species of concern or sensitive habitats, (3) evaluation of promising collision-reducing technologies and operational strategies with high potential for widespread implementation, and (4) coordinated research and data pooling to enable statistically robust analysis of infrequent, but potentially ecologically significant impacts for some species.},

abstract = {An individual based population model for bivalves was designed, built and tested in a 0D approach, to simulate the population dynamics of a mussel bed located in an intertidal area. The processes at the individual level were simulated following the dynamic energy budget theory, whereas initial egg mortality, background mortality, food competition, and predation (including cannibalism) were additional population processes. Model properties were studied through the analysis of theoretical scenarios and by simulation of different mortality parameter combinations in a realistic setup, imposing environmental measurements. Realistic criteria were applied to narrow down the possible combination of parameter values. Field observations obtained in the long-term and multi-station monitoring program were compared with the model scenarios. The realistically selected modeling scenarios were able to reproduce reasonably the timing of some peaks in the individual abundances in the mussel bed and its size distribution but the number of individuals was not well predicted. The results suggest that the mortality in the early life stages (egg and larvae) plays an important role in population dynamics, either by initial egg mortality, larvae dispersion, settlement failure or shrimp predation. Future steps include the coupling of the population model with a hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model to improve the simulation of egg/larvae dispersion, settlement probability, food transport and also to simulate the feedback of the organisms' activity on the water column properties, which will result in an improvement of the food quantity and quality characterization.},

abstract = {Global shrimp catches are reported primarily in association with large industrial trawling, but they also occur through small-scale fishing, which plays a substantial role in traditional communities. We developed an Ecopath model in north-eastern Brazil, and applied a temporally dynamic model (Ecosim) to evaluate the potential effects of different fishing effort control policies and environmental changes on marine resources and ecosystem between 2015 to 2030 with a case study for small-scale shrimp fishing, novelty for tropical region. These scenarios included different management options related to fishing controls (changing effort and closed season) and environmental changes (primary production changes). Our findings indicate that it is possible to maintain the same level of landings with a controlled reduction of bottom trawlers activities, for example, close to 10 %, without compromising the ecosystem structure. This scenario provided better results than 3–4 months of closing the fishing season, which led to significant losses in catches of high market-value target species (white shrimp, Penaeus schmitti and pink shrimp, Penaeus subtilis). However, intense negative effects on biomass, catch and biodiversity indicators were reported in scenarios with decreasing primary production, from 2 %, reinforcing the need to simulate and project the possible impacts caused by environmental change. However, the control of bottom trawling activity may help to reduce, even at low levels, the highly adverse effects due to primary production reduction. The impacts of climate change in a near future on organisms and ecosystems is an imminent reality, and therefore the search for measures for mitigating and even minimizing these impacts is crucial.},

abstract = {Xiamen Bay in South China has experienced extensive coastal exploitation since the 1950s, resulting in some severe environmental problems. Local authorities now have completed or are implementing many environmental restoration projects. Evaluating the cumulative impact of exploitation and restoration activities on the environment is a complicated multi-disciplinary problem. However, hydrodynamic changes in the bay caused by such coastal projects can be characterized directly and definitively through numerical modeling. This paper assesses the cumulative effect of coastal projects on the hydrodynamic setting using a high-resolution numerical modeling method that makes use of tidal current speeds and the tidal prism as two hydrodynamic indices. Changes in tidal velocity and the characteristics of the tidal prism show that hydrodynamic conditions have declined from 1938 to 2007 in the full-tide area. The tidal current speed and tidal prism have decreased by 40% in the western part of the bay and 20% in the eastern part of the bay. Because of the linear relationship between tidal prism and area, the degraded hydrodynamic conditions are anticipated to be restored to 1972 levels following the completion of current and proposed restoration projects, i. e. 33% and 15% decrease in the hydrodynamic conditions of 1938 for the western and eastern parts of the bay, respectively. The results indicate that hydrodynamic conditions can be restored to some extent with the implementation of a sustainable coastal development plan, although a full reversal of conditions is not possible. To fully assess the environmental changes in a region, more indices, e. g., water quality and ecosystem parameters, should be considered in future evaluations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

To partly address this knowledge gap, we tested if combining multimodel inference with generalized additive modelling could quantify the relative contribution of environmental variables on the population dynamics of a zooplankton species in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Hence, we have quantified the relative contribution of oceanographic variables (e.g. water temperature, salinity, nutrient concentrations, and chlorophyll a concentrations) and anthropogenic chemicals (i.e. polychlorinated biphenyls) to the density of Acartia clausi. We found that models with water temperature and chlorophyll a concentration explained ca. 73% of the population density of the marine copepod. Multimodel inference in combination with regression-based models are a generic way to disentangle and quantify multiple stressor-induced changes in marine ecosystems. Future–oriented simulations of copepod densities suggested increased copepod densities under predicted environmental changes.},

abstract = {In times of world crisis such as climate change and the COVID pandemic much has been said about the need for resilience. However, in scenarios of less concern about crisis the leading paradigm is often that of efficiency. The current study shows how efficiency might have got on the way of achieving the necessary resilience to face the COVID 19. With the example of the German brown shrimp fishery in the North Sea the interaction between those two paradigms – efficiency and resilience – is shown in the context of the COVID 19 pandemic. For instance, the quest of efficiency for rationalisation may reduce the resources available to set aside buffers to resist shocks, and the standardisation key to efficiency may also hinder more diversity and hence open innovation for solutions to the crisis, all characteristics of resilient organisations. By making use of a literature review including peer reviewed, grey literature and web media as well as of interviews with experts and quantitative data the value chain of the German brown shrimp fishery is analysed under the conceptual framework of organisational resilience. Results: show that, despite being more oriented towards efficiency, the German fleets does not show particularly good results in selected efficiency indicators. Additionally, key stages of the value chain as processing and commercialisation together with the investment strategy fail to present some commonly accepted components of resilient organisations, such as redundancy, flexibility, adaptability, diversity, prudence and embeddedness. Despite developments in the direction of sustainability with the MSC certification, the German fleet should pay attention to its capacity to face disturbances, which should be supported by a more long-term, targeted, resilience-oriented policy support.},

In many cases, these fish are commercial species that, if not caught, could increase the productivity of other fisheries. In January 2003, European legislation was implemented by Member States requiring all vessels fishing for brown shrimp to use selective trawls in order to minimise the bycatch of other commercial species. In complying with the regulations, however, the catch rate of the target species (the shrimp) is likely to be reduced. In this paper, we use a bioeconomic model to assess the impact of bycatch reduction devices on fishing effort, catch and profitability in the European Crangon fisheries. The potential benefits (in terms of higher future yields and consequently higher profits) to the white-fish fisheries are also estimated. From the model results, the regulation is expected to result in a net reduction in the profitability of the shrimp fishers. However, the benefits to the white-fish fishers is expected to more than offset this cost, resulting in an overall net benefit.},

abstract = {The brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) fishery is economically one of the most important fisheries in the North Sea. Fishing is unregulated, apart from the number of licenses and technical measures. The fishery has long been considered sustainable in terms of the effect on the target species, even though annual stocks are not regularly assessed. Average landings constantly increased annually and since 2000 have been 40% higher than in the 1980s and 1990s. Because brown shrimp lack a clear age structure and reproduce almost year-round, an age-based stock assessment is not possible. In the absence of a formal estimate of stock size, it is difficult to judge whether current fishing prac-tices can still be considered sustainable. Here, we use annual survey data collected during peak occurrence in late summer to obtain a depth-and area-stratified, swept-area estimate for the period 1970–2015. The resulting estimate of the total commercial-size shrimp bio-mass varied between 4000 and 21 000 tonnes over the years. Both parametric and non-parametric methods arrived at very similar results. In combination with length-based mortality estimates (as a proxy for production/biomass ratio), knowledge on the seasonal occurrence, catchability, gear efficiency, and their variation, total adult annual biomass production was estimated. Values ranged between 38 000 and 216 000 tonnes and overlapped at the lower end with total annual commercial landings, which varied between 8000 and 38 500 tonnes, in-dicating that in some years (1977, 1998, 2007), the larger part of the total brown shrimp production was harvested. Annual brown shrimp landings have gradually increased since the series started, whereas no trend in standing biomass and production was detected. Concurrent with the increase in landings, natural mortality of shrimp by predation has diminished. Considering the increase in fishing pressure and un-known consequence if natural predators recover or shrimp recruitment decreases, the lack of management for the brown shrimp fishery needs to be reconsidered.},

abstract = {Biodiversity is one of the key mechanisms that facilitate the adaptive response of planktonic communities to a fluctuating environment. How to allow for such a flexible response in marine ecosystem models is, however, not entirely clear. One particular way is to resolve the natural complexity of phytoplankton communities by explicitly incorporating a large number of species or plankton functional types. Alternatively, models of aggregate community properties focus on macroecological quantities such as total biomass, mean trait, and trait variance (or functional trait diversity), thus reducing the observed natural complexity to a few mathematical expressions. We developed the PhytoSFDM modelling tool, which can resolve species discretely and can capture aggregate community properties. The tool also provides a set of methods for treating diversity under realistic oceanographic settings. This model is coded in Python and is distributed as open-source software. PhytoSFDM is implemented in a zero-dimensional physical scheme and can be applied to any location of the global ocean. We show that aggregate community models reduce computational complexity while preserving relevant macroecological features of phytoplankton communities. Compared to species-explicit models, aggregate models are more manageable in terms of number of equations and have faster computational times. Further developments of this tool should address the caveats associated with the assumptions of aggregate community models and about implementations into spatially resolved physical settings (one-dimensional and three-dimensional). With PhytoSFDM we embrace the idea of promoting open-source software and encourage scientists to build on this modelling tool to further improve our understanding of the role that biodiversity plays in shaping marine ecosystems.},

We investigated this by using new, improved methods to sequence low-coverage genomes from 101 ancient humans from across Eurasia. We show that the Bronze Age was a highly dynamic period involving large-scale population migrations and replacements, responsible for shaping major parts of present-day demographic structure in both Europe and Asia. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesized spread of Indo-European languages during the Early Bronze Age. We also demonstrate that light skin pigmentation in Europeans was already present at high frequency in the Bronze Age, but not lactose tolerance, indicating a more recent onset of positive selection on lactose tolerance than previously thought.},

abstract = {Tidal flats are biogeomorphic landscapes, shaped by physical forces and interaction with benthic biota. We used a metabolic approach to assess the overarching effect of bioturbators on tidal landscapes. The benthic bivalve common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) was used as model organism. The effect of C. edule on sediment resuspension was approximated as a function of the overall population metabolic rate per unit of area. We combined i) laboratory observations on how C. edule affect sediment resuspension along gradients of bioturbation activity, sediment cohesiveness and hydrodynamic force with ii) spatial data on the natural distribution of intertidal C. edule populations. This allowed us to build an integrated model of the C. edule effect on sediment resuspension along the tidal gradient. Owing to the temperature dependence of metabolic rate, the model also accounted for seasonal variation in bioturbators activity. Laboratory experiments indicated that sediment resuspension is positively related to the metabolic rate of the C. edule population especially in cohesive sediments. Based on this observation, we predicted a clear spatial and seasonal pattern in the relative importance of C. edule contribution to sediment resuspension along a tidal transect. At lower elevations, our model indicates that hydrodynamics overrules biotic effects; at higher elevations, inter-tidal hydrodynamics should be too low to suspend bioturbated sediments. The influence of C. edule on sediment resuspension is expected to be maximal at the intermediate elevation of a mudflat, owing to the combination of moderate hydrodynamic stress and high bioturbator activity. Also, bio-mediated sediment resuspension is predicted to be particularly high in the warm season. Research into metabolic dependency of bio-mediated sediment resuspension may help to place phenomenological observations in the broader framework of metabolic theories in ecology and to formulate general expectations on the coastal ecosystem functioning.},

A sediment budget analysis reveals that the Wadden Sea is accumulating sediment. Changes in the ratio of intertidal to subtidal surface area indicate an extension of the intertidal zone. Most of the intertidal flats accumulate sediments with rates higher than the observed mean sea level rise in the German Bight, while simultaneously the subtidal mean depth increases. For the period of investigation this Wadden Sea steepening is quantified to averaged values of +7.9 mm/yr for the tidal flats and −20.0 mm/yr for the channels.},

abstract = {Non-point-source pollution is an increasing source of stress to aquatic, estuarine, and marine ecosystems. Such pollution may be of unknown etiology, distributed over extensive spatial scales, and comprised of multiple stressors. Current stressor-based paradigms for ecological risk assessment (ERA) may be insufficient to characterize risk from multiple stressors at regional spatial scales, necessitating the use of effects-based approaches. Historical data (1984-1999) for benthic macroinvertebrate biodiversity in Chesapeake Bay, USA, were incorporated into a geographic information system (GIS) and spatial analysis tools were used to model zones within the bay predicted to be of low or high anthropogenic impact. Data for benthic water quality and sediment toxicant concentrations from each of these zones were subsequently analyzed and compared to identify associations between benthic biodiversity and potential stressors. A number of stressors were significantly associated with high-impact zones, including increased nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, low dissolved oxygen, heavy metals, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and polychlorinated biphenyls. The spatial autocorrelation among multiple stressors suggests that traditional stressor-based approaches to ERA may result in the a priori exclusion of ecologically relevant stressors. Considering the effects of individual stressors rather than net effects of multiple stressors may result in underestimation of risk. The GISs are a useful tool for integrating multiple data sets in support of comprehensive regional ERA.},

An indicator system and model were proposed to assess the cumulative impact synthetically. Two coastal water bodies, namely Laizhou Bay (LZB) and Tianjin coastal waters (TCW), in the Bohai Sea of China were studied and compared, each in a different phase of reclamations. Case studies showed that the indicator scores of coastal ecosystem health in LZB and TCW were 0.75 and 0.68 out of 1.0, respectively. It can be concluded that coastal reclamations have a historically cumulative effect on benthic environment, whose degree is larger than that on aquatic environment.

abstract = {The environmental conditions in estuaries display distinct variability along the river-ocean mixing continuum from turbid, eutrophic freshwater to clear, oligotrophic offshore oceanic water. In order to understand the effects of suspended particulate matter (SPM), nutrient, and salinity on phytoplankton growth, this study investigated the response of a harmful dinoflagellate (Amphidinium carterae Hulburt) to the ecological gradients in estuary environments. Rapid nutrient uptake and growth of A. carterae were detected in the nutrient-rich clear water, while nutrient concentration had little impact on the cellular chlorophyll a (Chl-a) content at the stationary phase. Light attenuation caused by SPM not only inhibited the specific growth rate of A. carterae but also prolonged its adaption period in turbid water, resulting in a delayed and weakened growth response. The elevated cellular Chl-a content under high SPM conditions resulting from photo-acclimation led to the decoupling of cell density and Chl-a concentration, indicating that Chl-a is not a reliable indicator for phytoplankton abundance in turbid environments. The combined effect of SPM and nutrient on specific growth rate of A. carterae can be explained by the comparative effect model, while the multiplicative effect model better predicted their interactive effect on the growth inhibitory rate (GIR). There is a transit of dominant limiting factor for phytoplankton growth along the salinity gradient in estuary environments. Salinity (for marine phytoplankton cannot survive under low salinity condition) and SPM are the dominant limiting factors at low salinities in nearshore turbid environments, while nutrient depletion exerts the dominant inhibitory effect in high salinity offshore water. Depending on the balance between enhancing nutrient limitation and reducing light limitation with increasing salinity, blooms most likely occur in the “optimal growth region” at intermediate salinities where light and nutrient are both suitable for phytoplankton growth.},

abstract = {To reduce discarding of plaice Pleuronectes platessa in the North Sea flatfish fisheries, the major nursery areas were closed to large trawlers in 1995. The area closed was named the 'Plaice Box' (PB) and beam trawl effort fell by over 90%,while the exemption fleets of small flatfish beam trawlers, gill netters targeting sole (. Solea solea) and shrimp (. Crangon crangon) trawlers increased their effort. Contrary to the expectation, plaice landings and biomass declined. The initial support for the PB from the fisheries was lost, whereas other stakeholder groups claimed that any failure was due to the fact that fishing had never been completely prohibited in the area. To evaluate whether the PB has been an effective management measure, the changes in the ecosystem (plaice, demersal fish, benthos) and fisheries are analyzed to test whether the observed changes are due to the PB or to changes in the environment unrelated to the PB. Juvenile growth rate of plaice decreased and juveniles moved to deeper waters outside the PB. Demersal fish biomass decreased, whereas the abundance of epibenthic predators (. Asterias rubens and Cancer pagurus) increased in the PB. Endobenthos, in particular the main food items of plaice (polychaetes and small bivalves) remained stable or decreased both inside and outside the PB. Currently catches of both plaice and sole from within the PB are lower than in the late 1980s and the exemption fleet often prefers to fish outside the Plaice Box alongside much larger competitors. It is concluded that the observed changes are most likely related to changes in the North Sea ecosystem, which may be related to changes in eutrophication and temperature. It is less likely that they are related to the change in fishing. This case study highlights the importance of setting testable objectives and an appropriate evaluation framework including both ecological and socio-economic indicators when implementing closed areas. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We here argue that both limitations could be overcome if modellers in ecology would more often replicate existing models, try to break the models, and explore modifications. Replication comprises the re-implementation of an existing model and the replication of its results. Breaking models means to identify under what conditions the mechanisms represented in a model can no longer explain observed phenomena. The benefits of replication include less effort being spent to enter the iterative stage of model development and having more time for systematic robustness analysis. A culture of replication would lead to increased credibility, coherence and efficiency of computational modelling and thereby facilitate theory development.},

An individual-based population model for bivalves (using the Dynamic Energy Budget theory) was developed and coupled to a hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model (MOHID Water Modelling System). e result is a process oriented modelling tool that integrates physical, biogeochemical, ecological and physiological factors governing bivalve populated marine ecosystems. e model includes new techniques to simulate feeding processes using a mechanistic approach and a revised set of parameters is presented for the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis). e individual model was validated against observations, further extended to a population model and ultimately coupled to MOHID. A fully integrated modelling study was performed in the Balgzand ((e Netherlands). e model simulates, in a ne resolution domain, hydrodynamics (currents and water elevations), waves, heat, salt and sediment transport, biogeochemical cycle of nutrients, primary production and bivalve population dynamics. e study strengthens that there is no single mortality factor responsible for the population dynamics regulation. Early stage mortality (top-down) can control the persistence of new cohorts, in particular cannibalism and shrimp predation, although starvation (bottom-up) is the main process responsible for bivalve loss over the year in terms of biomass. e study also connrms and quantiies that bivalves do have the potential to innuence ecosystem functioning due to their role in nutrient cycling. e model is general enough to allow its application to any ecosystem with similar processes and it can simulate multiple species. Such a tool can be further used to characterize ecosystem response to diierent environmental changes (natural or anthropogenic) and to serve as an eeective and reliable management and decision making tool in estuaries and coastal areas.},

Assessing the state needs to be informed by thresholds above which state is defined as “good” for both the quality that defines good state, and the extent of the habitat that needs to be in such a quality. Operationalizing such thresholds has been carried out using a wide variety of approaches, with, often, haphazard and subjective outcomes. Here, we review approaches for setting “good-state” thresholds and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses for application to marine seabed ecosystems. Only two approaches defined a current ecologically meaningful good state and estimated thresholds quantitatively from data, while two other approaches (“avoid collapse” and “allow recovery”) would result in a state that could recover to good in the future. Other methods were subjective in the choice of threshold or based on statistically detectable thresholds rather than thresholds between good and not good or degraded state. We argue that the most objective method for setting a good-state threshold is based on maintaining the state within the range of natural variation in undisturbed systems. Preliminary time-series analyses of marine seabed community biomass suggest this threshold is located between 54 and 79% of the undisturbed state.},

abstract = {Coastal areas around the world are experiencing increasing disturbance from multiple stressors caused by anthropogenic activities. Although there is good knowledge about the impacts of individual stressors, there is less understanding of the consequences of several stressors acting simultaneously. Eutrophication and sediment deposition are widely recognized as major problems for the functioning of coastal systems, and they are expected to increase during the next decades. In a field experiment, using rock pools as a model system, different levels of nutrients and sedimentation were applied in a factorial experimental design that also accounted for the influence of molluscan grazers. Sedimentation significantly changed assemblage structure, mainly owing to an increase in turfing and filamentous algae and a decrease in crustose algae. Nutrients also caused an increase in the cover of green filamentous algae, which in turn was synergistically magnified by the removal of grazers. Here we showed that these stressors can individually alter the structure of rock pools assemblages; and that in this system top-down control (by grazers) is more important than bottom-up factors (nutrients) in controlling macroalgal assemblage structure. The combined effect of grazers loss and nutrients was larger than the sum of their individual effects. This study enhanced mechanistic understanding of the impacts of multiple stressors on coastal ecosystems, which will help to develop management strategies and conservation of the marine environment. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In New South Wales, Australia, a natural gradient of multiple stressors produced by acid sulfate soil effluent was used to determine the impact of exposure to multiple stressors on predator-prey dynamics between mud crabs Scylla serrata and Sydney rock oysters Saccostrea glomerata. Wild oysters were collected from two polluted and two reference sites that varied in their distance away from a flood gate that acted as a point source of water with low salinity, low pH and low alkalinity. Oysters from sites affected by multiple stressors and those from reference sites were offered to mud crabs in 48-h laboratory no-choice feeding trials. Oysters from affected sites had lower mortality than those from a reference site that was farthest from the source of polluted water. Linear models containing distance from flood gate best explained oyster mortality. Differences in rates of mortality were due to the decreased time crabs spent foraging on affected oysters. Long-term exposure to acid sulfate soil effluent alters trophic dynamics between predators and prey, which may have consequences for coastal food webs.},

abstract = {The countryside hosts an increasing number of alternative food networks: rural tourists can play an important role in acting as both consumer and “cultural broker” between these networks. This paper provides a theoretical framework for niche marketing food specialties in rural tourism by combining two different consumer behavioural theories, the “experience economy” and the “intimacy” model, representing a reorientation from classical marketing thinking. It explores the meaning of local food, including the pursuit of reconnection with nature, resilience to globalisation, the role of local food in reinforcing personal identity, the search for freshness, taste and authenticity, support for local producers, and environmental concerns. It considers the challenges for rural entrepreneurs and policy makers in marketing food specialties and rural regions to the post-modern consumer. Using examples derived mostly from secondary literature it identifies seven dimensions that elevate food products to an appealing culinary niche, namely, coherence, anti-capitalistic attitude, struggle against extinction, personal signature, mutual-disclosure, rituals of spatial and physical proximity, and sustainability-related practices. Food providers may use these features to signal food distinctiveness to rural tourists; policy makers can include them in their regional development models to enhance rural tourism without altering historically, socially, and environmentally layered culinary traditions.},

abstract = {Increasing numbers and speeds of vessels in areas with populations of cetaceans may have the cumulative effect of reducing habitat quality by increasing the underwater noise level. Here, we first use digital acoustic tags to demonstrate that free-ranging delphinids in a coastal deepwater habitat are subjected to varying and occasionally intense levels of vessel noise. Vessel noise and sound propagation measurements from a shallow-water habitat are then used to model the potential impact of high sound levels from small vessels on delphinid communication in both shallow and deep habitats, with bottlenose dolphins Tursiops sp. and short-finned pilot whales Globicephala macrorhynchus as model organisms. We find that small vessels travelling at 5 knots in shallow water can reduce the communication range of bottlenose dolphins within 50 m by 26%. Pilot whales in a quieter deep-water habitat could suffer a reduction in their communication range of 58% caused by a vessel at similar range and speed. Increased cavitation noise at higher speeds drastically increases the impact on the communication range. Gear shifts generate high-level transient sounds (peak-peak source levels of up to 200 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa) that may be audible over many kilometres and may disturb close-range animals. We conclude that noise from small vessels can significantly mask acoustically mediated communication in delphinids and contribute to the documented negative impacts on animal fitness. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2009.},

abstract = {The brown shrimp Crangon crangon is the target species of one of the largest crustacean fisheries in the North Sea, producing considerable amounts of bycatch every season. Mortality rates of bycaught juveniles have traditionally been considered negligible, but this assumption was based on studies with short haul durations and short observation times. We investigated shrimp mortality due to trawling and handling under conditions typical of the commercial shrimp fishery in the German Bight. A total of 1440 juvenile shrimps from 48 hauls with commercial beam trawls was analyzed in discard survival experiments, yielding insights into the effects of haul duration and two prevalent sieving methods (riddle and drum) on mortality rates. Shrimps were observed daily for three weeks to test for delayed mortality and moult performance as an indicator of fitness. On average, ca. 70% of the juvenile shrimps moulted successfully during the observation period, most of them (44.5%) in the first week. On average 6% of the shrimp were already dead in the pit. Mortalities of those transferred alive into the aquarium without passing the sieve reached mortalities over three weeks of up to 22% (June) in the 120 min hauls leading to a total mortality of 28%. Passage though a sieve resulted in a 67% (riddle sieve) or 100% (drum sieve) increase of mortality compared to the level that was observed from samples from the pit before sieving. In May 2016, a special situation was encountered with very high immediate (7.0–35.0%) and increased longer-term (19.4–31.9%) mortalities of juvenile shrimps regardless of treatment, indicating an unknown source of additional mortality. We hypothesize that these higher mortalities may be explained by undersized shrimp experiencing a repeated passage of the catch and sorting process of different vessels. In fact, our study emphasizes that bycatch mortalities of undersized shrimps estimated in earlier studies have been severely underestimated.},

This work assessed the efficacy of various trawl modifications aimed at reducing small shrimp discarding. Changes to the mesh size of the codend (i.e. 16, 22, 24 and 26 mm) and also forward parts of the net were evaluated (multi-mesh trawl). Of all the trawl modifications investigated, the fitting of a 26 mm codend to a shrimp trawl was shown to be the most effective and reduced the catches of small shrimp by 13%. Such a trawl modification is however less effective than fitting a sieve net inside a shrimp trawl, which can reduce such shrimp catches of small shrimp by 16-26%.

abstract = {Small mesh codends applied in the brown shrimp (Crangon crangon L.) fishery in the North Sea cause large bycatch of fish, invertebrates and undersized shrimp. We investigated the most obvious and enforceable mitigation measure: the increase of mesh size beyond 20 mm, which was the medium mesh size of the fleet before 2016. The predicted selectivity from different codend designs was applied in a yield-per-recruit model able to reproduce the seasonal pattern of landings and biomass by sex, size, and age. The model enables assessment and quantifying population responses to possible management actions, also considering other influential variables such as natural mortality, which vastly decreased during the 1990s to the contemporary low level due to the decrease of cod in the Southern North Sea. Model results show that the selectivity of 20 mm codends leads to the poorest fishery and population indexes. Any increase in mesh size within the range considered and in the present low-predator situation would lead to a larger shrimp stock and higher catches. Increasing mesh size reduces catches of undersized and small commercial-sized shrimps entering the fishery mainly in summer time, thus leading to surplus catches in autumn and spring. Model results reveal that an increase of mesh size diminishes growth overfishing and allows the formation of a larger stock that may better cope a fluctuating natural mortality and the steadily upwards creeping fishing intensity.},

abstract = {Best practice for environmental modelling generally aims to increase the accuracy, utility and rigour of models when used as decision-support tools. Despite the wide-spread documentation of best practice, models are frequently and easily challenged during environmental decision-making processes, at least partly because of poor implementation of best practice guidance. We postulate that there is a two-sided gap of understanding between those tasked with making environmental decisions informed by model simulations (i.e., the end users), and modellers charged with generating and interpreting model outputs for environmental decision-making processes. This gap, or disconnect, can mean that best practice is not always implemented in modelling projects. Here we describe a strategic framework that aims to facilitate the implementation of appropriate best practice guidelines to improve the defensibility of the modelling and provide a structured approach to improving communication between modellers and end users. The framework incorporates four phases: 1) initial scoping and investigation, 2) planning, 3) model implementation and evaluation, and 4) model application. At the end of each phase is a hold point that asks a critical question, such as whether modelling is the appropriate tool, or whether the model is adequate for the intended purpose. There is an emphasis on communication between end users and modellers in each phase, and feedback loops to allow for commentary from end users or peer reviewers to be addressed. The framework can be applied to any environmental domain but is sufficiently prescriptive to ensure that best practice guidance for specific domains and model applications can be identified and implemented.},

abstract = {The ICES Working Group on Crangon Fisheries and Life History (WGCRAN) examines the various interactions of the brown shrimp to better understand the species.

Stock status indicators were deduced from scientific surveys and indicated (1) a high shrimp biomass in 2018 compared to the years before and after, (2) a lower fraction of large shrimp compared to previous years, especially in 2019 and 2020, and (3) an above-average total mortality in 2019. North Sea landings were exceptionally high in 2018, but below average in 2019 and 2020 when compared to the mean of the last two decades. Total effort in 2018 was above average, but a distinct effort reduction occurred in the following years due to storage and processing bottlenecks in the industry.

Average Landing Per Unit Effort (LPUE) in 2018 was almost twice as high as in 2017, the year with the lowest value of the times-series. In the following years LPUE decreased by about 30%. The high LPUEs in 2018 were supported by a strong shrimp cohort entering the fishery in autumn 2018. LPUEs in the first half of 2019 were still generated by the overwintering 2018-cohort. These high LPUE values, were followed by moderate and below-average values in 2020, with Germany and Denmark showing the lowest values. To ensure standardized effort data and investigate spatial patterns, Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and logbook data were analysed. Here, LPUEs showed a significant negative trend in the first quarter for all regions, with the steepest decrease in the North. Up to 86% of the variability in summer landings in German and Danish waters could be explained by the effort in the preceding winter months in two southern areas. Altogether this hints toward a possible impact on the following recruitment by excess fishing effort in winter.

Existing and planned measures of the self-management were evaluated and tested. Undersized shrimp in catches decreased after the introduction of the self-management, suggesting a positive effect of mesh size increase on the population structure. The Harvest Control Rule failed to protect the poor stock in the Northern region in 2016 and 2017, mainly because reference values are too low and because higher catches in the southern regions managed to keep the mean LPUE just above the reference values. National sampling campaigns started to quantify bycatches and test the “de minimis” exemption in the brown shrimp fishery.},

On-going criticism by Dutch fishers on the North Sea beam trawl survey prompted scientists to invite fishers on board. Since 2007, fishers have annually joined the survey as observers. Observing all steps in the survey like rigging the gear, the selection of fishing locations, catch sorting, and data registration enables fishers to provide feedback based on their experience instead of preconceptions. Where possible, their suggestions for improvements are incorporated. Since fishers joined, the nature of discussions about the survey has changed to being constructive. The fishing industry's trust in survey methods, results, and the scientific crew increased. Scientists gained a better understanding of the importance of the survey for fishers' livelihoods. The observers also inspired continuous scientific scrutiny of the survey, its setup, and objectives. We describe the process of incorporating fishers in a fishery-independent survey, its benefits, and challenges. We show how perceptions about the survey changed. Allowing stakeholders behind the scenes of a survey and taking their expertise into account contributes to a more reciprocal relation in the co-production of knowledge through collaborative research and increases legitimacy.

As a standardized document for providing a consistent, logical and readable account of the structure and dynamics of ABMs, some research groups also find it useful as a workflow for model design. Even so, there are still limitations to ODD that obstruct its more widespread adoption. Such limitations are discussed and addressed in this paper: the limited availability of guidance on how to use ODD; the length of ODD documents; limitations of ODD for highly complex models; lack of sufficient details of many ODDs to enable reimplementation without access to the model code; and the lack of provision for sections in the document structure covering model design ratio-nale, the model's underlying narrative, and the means by which the model's fitness for purpose is evaluated. We document the steps we have taken to provide better guidance on: structuring complex ODDs and an ODD summary for inclusion in a journal article (with full details in supplementary material; Table 1); using ODD to point readers to relevant sections of the model code; update the document structure to include sections on model rationale and evaluation. We also further advocate the need for standard descriptions of simulation experiments and argue that ODD can in principle be used for any type of simulation model.

Based on data submitted by Member States under the EU MAP, there were 57 236 active vessels in 2019 offering direct employment to 129 540 fishers, corresponding to 92 298 FTEs; on average earning EUR 23 620 in wages, annually. The EU fleet spent 6.0 million days-at-sea and consumed 2.0 billion litres of fuel to land 4.05 million tonnes of seafood with a reported value of EUR 6.3 billion. The Gross Value Added (GVA) and gross profit (all excl. subsidies and fishing rights) were estimated at EUR 3.4 billion and EUR 1.25 billion, respectively. GVA as a proportion of revenue was estimated at 53\% and gross profit margin at 20\%. With a total net profit of almost EUR 0.6 billion in 2019, 9.0\% of the revenue was retained as profit. These results indicate a deterioration compared to 2018 while nowcast estimates suggest that the performance of the EU fishing fleet will be moderately (if compared to 2019) and heavily (if compared to 2018) deteriorated in 2020 and 2021, although partially outweighed by the reduction in fuel costs in 2020.

abstract = {In an increasingly interconnected climate of complexity, the stabilization of human-environment interactions is a major challenge in international relations and demands the integration of complexity science with global governance. This chapter highlights several cases of complex crises where cascading events affect international stability. Climate change is considered as a risk multiplier which disturbs the balance between natural and social systems and amplifies the consequences through complex impact chains that affect the functioning of critical infrastructures and supply networks; intensify the nexus of water, energy and food; lead to production losses, price increases and financial crises in other regions through global markets; undermine human security, social living conditions and political stability; and trigger or aggravate migration movements and conflict situations. An integrative framework of human-environment interaction is used to analyse destabilizing developments, tipping elements and cascading risks, as well as concepts of resilience, viability and sustainable peace. Whether climate stress fuels a cycle of violence or climate policy drives a transition towards a cycle of cooperation and sustainable peace depends on the human and societal responses. Strategies for viability transformations and adaptive governance range from climate mitigation and adaptation and the building of social networks to new capabilities of disaster management, crisis prevention and conflict resolution. Several examples are presented showing how transition and transformation processes can be analysed with an agent-based model framework.},

abstract = {The North Sea brown shrimp fishery is currently regulated neither with quotas nor with effort management. The current paradigm of non-man- agement was based on an analysis of the total predation by cod and whiting in relation to commercial catches for the period 1970–1995 and the estimated total dominance of natural mortality. However, since this period, the North Sea ecosystem has undergone pronounced changes with overfishing and climate change causing a substantial decline in predator stocks, namely cod and whiting. In addition, both predators have shifted their range of distribution causing a reduced overlap with brown shrimp. Here, we extend the previous assessment of brown shrimp pre- dation for the years 1996–2011 using updated stock assessment and predator distribution data. For the first time, predation estimates are used together with commercial landings to partition independent estimates of total mortality into fishing and predation mortality. We demonstrate that the decline ofkeypredators ofbrownshrimp in combination with a shift in the distributional range ofthe predators has caused anewsituation, in which the fishery has become the main mortality source ofadult brownshrimp (.50 mm).Average landings since 2000 have been ?40\% higher than in the 1980s and 1990s, indicating that humans have at least partly taken over the share previously taken by juvenile whiting and cod. We discuss that this situation is likely to continue, because three marine mammal species have built up a combined population of over 80 000 indi- viduals, which hunt for potential brown shrimp predators mainly in the distribution area ofbrown shrimp. The application oftwo yield-per-recruit models of different complexity indicates potential growth overfishing of brown shrimp and reopens the discussion of management.},

Research is split into three separate areas of inquiry - movement models based on random walks, individual-based models based on optimal foraging theory, and a statistical modelling approach - which have developed without much productive contact. Here we review recent advances in modelling home range behaviour, focusing particularly on the problem of identifying mechanisms that lead to the emergence of stable home ranges from unbounded movement paths. We discuss the issue of spatiotemporal scale, which is rarely considered in modelling studies, as well as highlighting the need to consider more closely the dynamical nature of home ranges. Recent methodological and theoretical advances may soon lead to a unified approach, however, conceptually unifying our understanding of linkages among home range behaviour and ecological or evolutionary processes. {\textcopyright}2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Bycatch of seabirds and marine mammals in gillnet fisheries is a major hazard for conservation globally. Measures for bycatch mitigation in fisheries management mostly base on technological and ecological findings and they generally assume fishers as a homogenous group that is supposed to apply new technology or act according to the latest ecological insights. There is often a lack of knowledge about the heterogeneity of fishers′ actions and drivers, despite its importance for effective fisheries management. For the specific case of the German gillnet fleet in the Baltic Sea a qualitative social-science research approach was chosen to generate knowledge that can inform management. In applying the concept of agency, three types of fishers′ actions are distinguished: projective (future-oriented), evaluative (present-oriented) and iterational (past-oriented). Fishers′ attitude towards incidental bycatch differed between viewing bycatch as a normal part of the daily routine or as a disturbing event. These findings are discussed in the context of management instruments, such as closed fishing zones and seasons, brought up during an expert workshop. It is concluded that considering fishers′ agency may be an important contribution to design effective management instruments to mitigate bycatch of seabirds and marine mammals in gillnet fisheries.},

abstract = {Shelf and coastal sea processes extend from the atmosphere through the water column and into the seabed. These processes reflect intimate interactions between physical, chemical, and biological states on multiple scales. As a consequence, coastal system modelling requires a high and flexible degree of process and domain integration; this has so far hardly been achieved by current model systems. The lack of modularity and flexibility in integrated models hinders the exchange of data and model components and has historically imposed the supremacy of specific physical driver models. We present the Modular System for Shelves and Coasts (MOSSCO; http://www.mossco.de), a novel domain and process coupling system tailored but not limited to the coupling challenges of and applications in the coastal ocean. MOSSCO builds on the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) and on the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (FABM). It goes beyond existing technologies by creating a unique level of modularity in both domain and process coupling, including a clear separation of component and basic model interfaces, flexible scheduling of several tens of models, and facilitation of iterative development at the lab and the station and on the coastal ocean scale. MOSSCO is rich in metadata and its concepts are also applicable outside the coastal domain. For coastal modelling, it contains dozens of example coupling configurations and tested set-ups for coupled applications. Thus, MOSSCO addresses the technology needs of a growing marine coastal Earth system community that encompasses very different disciplines, numerical tools, and research questions.},

Theoretical parallels suggest the diversity of fishing fleets may have a similarly important role in determining the productivity and ecological impacts of fisheries, but this possibility has rarely been explored. Here I present theoretical analyses showing that the diversity of metiers—combinations of technology, target species, and fishing grounds-and technical efficiencies in a fishing fleet have important impacts on the productivity, profitability, and ecological impacts of fisheries, particularly mixed-stock or multispecies fisheries. Diversification of metiers can increase yields and reduce threats to weak stocks in both managed and unmanaged multispecies fisheries. Diversification of technical efficiencies creates opportunities for larger profits in managed fisheries, but often decreases yields and worsens impacts on weak stocks in unmanaged fisheries. These results suggest that the potential impact of management may be highest in fisheries with diverse fleets.},

abstract = {Some scientists argue, with reference to Popper's scientific philosophical school, that models cannot be verified or validated. Other scientists and many practitioners nevertheless use these terms, but with very different meanings. As a result of an increasing number of examples of model malpractice and mistrust to the credibility of models, several modelling guidelines are being elaborated in recent years with the aim of improving the quality of modelling studies. This gap between the views and the lack of consensus experienced in the scientific community and the strongly perceived need for commonly agreed modelling guidelines is constraining the optimal use and benefits of models. This paper proposes a framework for quality assurance guidelines, including a consistent terminology and a foundation for a methodology bridging the gap between scientific philosophy and pragmatic modelling. A distinction is made between the conceptual model, the model code and the site-specific model. A conceptual model is subject to confirmation or falsification like scientific theories. A model code may be verified within given ranges of applicability and ranges of accuracy, but it can never be universally verified. Similarly, a model may be validated, but only with reference to site-specific applications and to pre-specified performance (accuracy) criteria. Thus, a model's validity will always be limited in terms of space, time, boundary conditions and types of application. This implies a continuous interaction between manager and modeller in order to establish suitable accuracy criteria and predictions associated with uncertainty analysis. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Bastardie2022,
abstract = {To effectively future-proof the management of the European Union fishing fleets we have explored a suite of case studies encompassing the northeast and tropical Atlantic, the Mediterranean, Baltic and Black Seas. This study shows that European Union (EU) fisheries are likely resilient to climate-driven short-term stresses, but may be negatively impacted by long-term trends in climate change. However, fisheries' long-term stock resilience can be improved (and therefore be more resilient to increasing changes in climate) by adopting robust and adaptive fisheries management, provided such measures are based on sound scientific advice which includes uncertainty. Such management requires regular updates of biological reference points. Such updates will delineate safe biological limits for exploitation, providing both high long-term yields with reduced risk of stock collapse when affected by short-term stresses, and enhanced compliance with advice to avoid higher than intended fishing mortality. However, high resilience of the exploited ecosystem does not necessarily lead to the resilience of the economy of EU fisheries from suffering shocks associated with reduced yields, neither to a reduced carbon footprint if fuel use increases from lower stock abundances. Fuel consumption is impacted by stock development, but also by changes in vessel and gear technologies, as well as fishing techniques. In this respect, energy-efficient fishing technologies already exist within the EU, though implementing them would require improving the uptake of innovations and demonstrating to stakeholders the potential for both reduced fuel costs and increased catch rates. A transition towards reducing fuel consumption and costs would need to be supported by the setup of EU regulatory instruments. Overall, to effectively manage EU fisheries within a changing climate, flexible, adaptive, well-informed and well-enforced management is needed, with incentives provided for innovations and ocean literacy to cope with the changing conditions, while also reducing the dependency of the capture fishing industry on fossil fuels. To support such management, we provide 10 lessons to characterize ‘win-win' fishing strategies for the European Union, which develop leverages in which fishing effort deployed corresponds to Maximum Sustainable Yield targets and Common Fisheries Policy minimal effects objectives. In these strategies, higher catch is obtained in the long run, less fuel is spent to attain the catch, and the fisheries have a higher resistance and resilience to shock and long-term factors to face climate-induced stresses.},

abstract = {Global concerns about CO2 emissions, national CO2 quotas, and rising fuel prices are incentives for the commercial fishing fleet industry to change their fishing practices and reduce fuel consumption, which constitutes a significant part of fishing costs. Vessel-based fuel consumption, energy efficiency (quantity of fish caught per litre of fuel used), and profitability are factors that we simulated in developing a spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM) for fishing vessel movements. The observed spatial and seasonal patterns of fishing effort for each fishing activity are evaluated against three alternative effort allocation scenarios for the assumed fishermen's adaptation to these factors: (A) preferring nearby fishing grounds rather than distant grounds with potentially larger catches and higher values, (B) shifting to other fisheries targeting resources located closer to the harbour, and (C) allocating effort towards optimising the expected area-specific profit per trip. The model is informed by data from each Danish fishing vessel >15m after coupling its high resolution spatial and temporal effort data (VMS) with data from logbook landing declarations, sales slips, vessel engine specifications, and fish and fuel prices. The outcomes of scenarios A and B indicate a trade-off between fuel savings and energy efficiency improvements when effort is displaced closer to the harbour compared to reductions in total landing amounts and profit. Scenario C indicates that historic effort allocation has actually been sub-optimal because increased profits from decreased fuel consumption and larger landings could have been obtained by applying a different spatial effort allocation. Based on recent advances in VMS and logbooks data analyses, this paper contributes to improve the modelling of fishing effort allocation, fuel consumption and catch distribution on a much disaggregated level compared to the fleet-based models we developed so far. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Climate change-driven alterations in storm frequency and intensity threaten the wellbeing of billions of people who depend on fisheries for food security and livelihoods. Weather conditions shape vulnerability to both loss of life and reduced fishing opportunities through their influence on fishers' daily participation decisions. The trade-off between physical risk at sea and the economic rewards of continued fishing under adverse weather conditions is a critical component of fishers' trip decisions but is poorly understood. We employed a stated choice experiment with skippers from a temperate mixed-species fishery in southwest England to empirically assess how fishers trade off the risks from greater wind speed and wave height with the benefits of expected catch and prices. Technical fishing and socio-economic data were collected for individual fishers to identify the factors influencing trade-off decisions. Fishers preferred increased wind speed and wave height up to a threshold, after which they became increasingly averse to worsening conditions. Fishing gear, vessel length, presence of crew, vessel ownership, age, recent fishing success and reliance on fishing income all influenced the skippers' decisions to go to sea. This study provides a first insight into the socio-economic, environmental, and technical fishing factors that can influence the sensitivity of individual fishers to changing storminess. These insights can help to inform fisheries climate vulnerability assessments and the development of adaptation measures.},

This option is based on assumptions that fishing is a dirty, hard, undesirable occupation, hence employment of last resort and that fishers are amongst the poorest of the poor; and that the poor care little about the type of job they have as long as they make enough to live. This paper first examines the quality of evidence supporting these assertions. It then analyses primary data concerning aspects of job satisfaction among small-scale fishers in the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam. The analyses indicate that most fishers would not leave fishing for an alternative occupation, citing income as well as non-income factors for resisting the change. This leads to the conclusion that the above assumptions are not consistent with either the literature or the current analysis. Hence, fishery policy based on these assumptions or the uninformed sponsorship of alternative employment is likely to fail. {\textcopyright}2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Based on data submitted by Member States under the EU MAP, there were 57 236 active vessels in 2019 offering direct employment to 129 540 fishers, corresponding to 92 298 FTEs; on average earning EUR 23 620 in wages, annually. The EU fleet spent 6.0 million days-at-sea and consumed 2.0 billion litres of fuel to land 4.05 million tonnes of seafood with a reported value of EUR 6.3 billion. The Gross Value Added (GVA) and gross profit (all excl. subsidies and fishing rights) were estimated at EUR 3.4 billion and EUR 1.25 billion, respectively. GVA as a proportion of revenue was estimated at 53\% and gross profit margin at 20\%. With a total net profit of almost EUR 0.6 billion in 2019, 9.0\% of the revenue was retained as profit. These results indicate a deterioration compared to 2018 while nowcast estimates suggest that the performance of the EU fishing fleet will be moderately (if compared to 2019) and heavily (if compared to 2018) deteriorated in 2020 and 2021, although partially outweighed by the reduction in fuel costs in 2020.

abstract = {In this study, logbook, landings, and vessel monitoring system data of German brown shrimp (Crangon crangon L.) fishers were combined to analyse spatial and temporal distribution patterns. Landings per unit effort (LPUE) were standardized to the efficiency level of a reference vessel. The standardization altered the spatial-Temporal patterns of the LPUE as the vessels differed by a factor of up to 4.7. LPUE data were separated into two size classes according to sieve fractions. Small brown shrimps were characterized by LPUE values increasing early in the year in shallow waters, especially in estuaries in July. Subsequently, peak LPUE values are reached at the end of September in all depths, but with variable spatial patterns between years. LPUE data indicate a general outward migration between early summer and winter. In winter, large shrimp shows a clear increase in LPUE with depths mainly in regions adjacent to the Dutch coast and a reversed pattern close to the Danish coast. The large size class in winter-which consists mainly of mature or egg-bearing females-showed high LPUE values along two persistent diagonal bands in the German Bight. These patterns could lead to local recruitment overfishing, if fishermen are aware of such patterns.},

abstract = {We explore the potential of using data from Australia's northern prawn fishery (NPF) vessel monitoring system(s) (VMS) to examine trawl track, trawling intensity, and stock depletion due to trawling. We simulate VMS data by subsampling global positioning system (GPS) fixes from the NPF fishing vessels at different polling intervals to examine their accuracy in describing trawl tracks. The results of the simulations suggest that VMS data with polling intervals longer than 30 min cannot accurately estimate trawl tracks. The analysis of high-polling-frequency VMS data collected in four (later reduced to three) 6 nautical mile × 6 nautical mile grids that historically received high levels of fishing effort showed that trawling was not random and some areas were trawled up to 28 times in the tiger prawn fishing season and the impact varied among years. The results of a catch-depletion analysis suggest that fishery catch- per-unit-effort and cumulative catch may not be proportional to overall target-species biomass in areas with highly aggregated trawl effort. The VMS data also showed a large number of trawls can occur in productive areas and that trawling impacts on benthos may be quite marked.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to develop a heuristic model to account for the attachment that many particularly successful fishermen seem to have to their occupation. It is argued here that the relatively risky nature of the occupation of fishing attracts and holds individuals manifesting an active, adventurous, aggressive, and courageous personality; hence, these risky components of the job have a positive influence on their levels of happiness. There is more to fishing than money. What other occupation is reflected in a popular recreational activity like marine sport fishing? It takes one into a different environment, away from shore-based activities and allows participants to become involved in the thrill of the hunt, pitting ones' luck and skill against others as well as against elusive prey hidden beneath the water. As a consequence, some fishermen resist leaving the occupation even when economic returns suggest they should. The paper first develops a heuristic human ecology model that illustrates relationships between aspects of the physical, political, and social environments that generate stress among commercial fishermen. The model is then elaborated to include psychological, biobehavioral, technological, ideological and social adaptations that mediate between the stress causing variables and the individual fisherman, reducing or eliminating the stress. A possible genetic component is also discussed. The model is discussed in terms of its application to fisheries management in New England and elsewhere. {\textcopyright}Society for Human Ecology.},

abstract = {The processes that cause and influence movement are one of the main points of enquiry in movement ecology. However, ecology is not the only discipline interested in movement: a number of information sciences are specialising in analysis and visualisation of movement data. The recent explosion in availability and complexity of movement data has resulted in a call in ecology for new appropriate methods that would be able to take full advantage of the increasingly complex and growing data volume. One way in which this could be done is to form interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and experts from information sciences that analyse movement. In this paper we present an overview of new movement analysis and visualisation methodologies resulting from such an interdisciplinary research network: the European COST Action "MOVE - Knowledge Discovery from Moving Objects" (http://www.move-cost.info). This international network evolved over four years and brought together some 140 researchers from different disciplines: those that collect movement data (out of which the movement ecology was the largest represented group) and those that specialise in developing methods for analysis and visualisation of such data (represented in MOVE by computational geometry, geographic information science, visualisation and visual analytics). We present MOVE achievements and at the same time put them in ecological context by exploring relevant ecological themes to which MOVE studies do or potentially could contribute.},

abstract = {Home range is a standard concept in animal ecology and behavior but few people try to understand what home ranges mean to the animals that have them and often assume that a home-range estimate, quantified using some method, is the home range. This leads to 2 problems. First, researchers put much energy into discerning and using the best methods for estimating home ranges while no one understands, really, what a home range is. Second, maps delineating home-range estimates may have little connection with what home ranges are and what they mean to the animals that have them. To gain insight into these problems, Roger Powell (hereafter, Roger) documented his own use of space for 65 days, obtaining complete data on where he went, what he did, and how much energy and money he expended and gained in each place. Roger's use of space is consistent with how other mammals use space and, therefore, examination of his data provides insight into what a home range is and how ecologists should approach quantifying other animals' home ranges. We present estimates of Roger's home range in 5 different metrics, or currencies, that provide important and different insights. Home-range estimators that combine different types of information to estimate the spatial distribution and qualities of resources that structure animal behavior (i.e., fitness surfaces) will probably provide the most insight into animals' home ranges. To make reasonable estimates of home ranges, researchers must collect data on habitat, resources, and other attributes of the landscape, so that they can understand basic behaviors of animals and understand how animals may view their environment. We propose that the best concept of a home range is that part of an animal's cognitive map of its environment that it chooses to keep updated. {\textcopyright}2012 American Society of Mammalogists.},

abstract = {The potential environmental effect of the brown shrimp fishery in the shallow shelf of the North Sea and Wadden Sea is debated because the fishery operates for a large part in designated Natura2000 sites. In this fishery a beam trawl is pulled along the seafloor, potentially affecting organisms living on and in the seabed. Because the effect by the trawl used in the shrimp fishery is unclear, has long been debated, and hardly studied to date, we carried out an experimental study to test short to medium term effects of the fishery on the benthic community in an area with a decadal long fishery. The study consisted of two complementing parts: one experiment focussed on the effect of a single fishing event in 15 different areas throughout the distribution area of shrimp fishery along the coast and in the Wadden Sea; in another experiment we measured the dose-response relationship between fishing intensity and the benthic community in one area in the Wadden Sea. Unfortunately, the first experiment was severely hampered by unplanned fishing by fishermen. Instead of the originally planned BACI design with 15 replicates, the first experiment was analysed by correlating actual fishing intensity and benthos community parameters. We found a negative relationship between fishing pressure and the change in number of species from pre- (T0) and post-fishing (T1, eight weeks later), but not in total density or Pielou's evenness. In the second experiment the change between T0 and T1, ten weeks later and T2, eight months later) in Pielou's evenness was negatively related to fishing pressure. The change in total density and the number of species were unrelated to fishing intensity. The pattern in evenness was primarily due to the positive relationship of the change of Ensis leei with fishing pressure. For eight of the ten most common individual macrofauna species, there was no relationship between their development and fishing pressure, while for two species the change in density showed a negative relationship with fishing pressure in the T0-T1 (Ascidia sp.) or T0-T2 comparison (Cerastoderma edule). We interpret the observed response in Ensis leei as their ability to relocate and quickly colonise space, that became vacant because the original inhabitants were disturbed, removed or died. Especially this last finding, that an apparently mobile opportunistic species is able to colonise vacant space is a fishery-related mechanism that adds to the understanding of the potential effect of shrimp fisheries.},

abstract = {Understanding the drivers of greenhouse gas emissions in food production systems is becoming urgent. For wild capture fisheries, fuel use during the fishing phase generally dominates emissions and is highly variable between fisheries. Fuel use is also essential for the economy of the fisheries, but fuel-intensive fisheries can still be profitable due to fuel subsidies, in particular, if the target species is of high value. Developing an innovative bottom-up approach based on detailed catch and spatial fishing effort data, in the absence of direct fuel data, we analysed the fuel use intensity (fuel use per kg landed) and economic efficiency (landing value per litre fuel used) of Danish capture fisheries for the period 2005-2019. An overall decline in fishing effort did not significantly affect the overall fuel use intensity and efficiency, which was stable for most of the fleet segments and marine species. Robust differences in fuel use intensity among individual fisheries, reflected differential spatial accessibility and vulnerability of target species to fishing. In addition, different fishing techniques targeting the same set of species showed differences in fuel use per unit landed. Danish seining and gillnets had a lower fuel use intensity and higher economic efficiency than demersal trawling; and purse seining than pelagic trawling. The variability between stocks and fleets also indicates that there is generally potential for improvement in overall efficiency from improved stock status. Short-term management actions to promote the best available fuel-efficient fishing techniques combined with additional long-term actions to secure the recovery of stocks have the potential to reduce fishery greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable fisheries and normative environmental management are crucial to developing incentives towards reducing fuel use whenever the fishing sector industry and science work jointly at implementing solutions, as incentives for the industry to reduce fuel use are limited as long as the fishing activity is profitable.},

abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of the small-scale fishing sector in Germany. The small-scale fleet is defined here as including vessels up to 24 m in length that are usually family owned and operate in the Baltic and North Seas. The fleet comprises of beam trawlers, cutter trawlers and vessels employing passive gears. Target species are brown shrimp and flatfish in the North Sea and herring, cod, flatfish and certain freshwater species in the Baltic Sea. Beam trawlers only fish in the coastal North Sea, whereas the small gill netters are based exclusively along the Baltic coast. The North and Baltic Seas have very different physical conditions. The North Sea has substantial tidal influence and normal marine salinity, while the Baltic Sea has minimal tidal influence and brackish water. After the introduction of the Common Fisheries Policy in 1983 (in East Germany 1990), individual quotas were issued. Most small-scale fishers are organised by producer organisations. They can be subject to additional conservation regulations which only apply to coastal zones. The increasing demand for fish stemming from fisheries which are certified as sustainable might impose further restrictions on small-scale fisheries. Most fishers employing passive gear have been in a steadily precarious economic situation due to very small quotas. Thus, their number is continuously decreasing. The shrimp and cutter fleets are in a healthier economic state, owing to their fishing of unregulated species (shrimp) or having the possibility to fish in both the Baltic and North Seas (cutter trawler fleet). Despite these advantages, investment in new vessels is extremely scarce in German small-scale fisheries.},

For remote island nations, the challenges are compounded by a loosely understood association of pelagic stocks to the ocean environment, and the tyranny of distance in monitoring and surveilling large exclusive economic zones (EEZ). An approach to ocean conservation is establishing protected areas, with the Pacific island nation of Palau as a leader with the recently established National Marine Sanctuary, which closes 80% of their EEZ to commercial fishing in 2020. Here we present an EEZ-wide analysis of Palau commercial fishing over a 6-year period (2011–2016), and develop a system for predicting fishing activity accounting for oceanic variables, climate indices, and vessel flag. Linking pelagic habitat to fishing activity provides high-resolution decision aids for management, highlighting the need for EEZ-specific analyses in addressing fisheries.},

Our study investigates whether the accumulation of epifauna, dominated by the filter feeder Mytilus edulis (blue mussel), on turbine structures affects pelagic primary productivity and ecosystem functioning in the southern North Sea. We estimate the anthropogenically increased potential distribution based on the current projections of turbine locations and reported patterns of M. edulis settlement. This distribution is integrated through the Modular Coupling System for Shelves and Coasts to state-of-the-art hydrodynamic and ecosystem models. Our simulations reveal non-negligible potential changes in regional annual primary productivity of up to 8% within the OWF area, and induced maximal increases of the same magnitude in daily productivity also far from the wind farms. Our setup and modular coupling are effective tools for system scale studies of other environmental changes arising from large-scale offshore wind farming such as ocean physics and distributions of pelagic top predators.},

abstract = {The links between the behaviour of fishers, the marine environment and fisheries management institutions are poorly understood. There is a widespread lack of compliance with fisheries management, and fisheries policy has failed to develop the ability to understand and anticipate fisher behaviour in advance of regulations, or learn how to shape individual behaviour in ways that promote societal management goals. An in-depth understanding of fisher decision-making is required to design appropriate incentives to improve the ecosystem functioning, the efficiency and profitability of fishing enterprises, and improve the well being of fishing communities. This thesis attempts to help redress the imbalance between understanding the resource itself and the resource users. It adds to our understanding of the complexity of individual fisher and fishing fleet behaviour by challenging the standard models used to understand behaviour. It examines the behavioural economics of fishers as well as the psychological, cultural and social determinants of individual behaviour. An interdisciplinary methodology was used to unveil the heterogeneity of fisher behaviour as well as the patterns of fisher decision making. Specifically, this thesis presents a comprehensive review of the literature, synthesising and summarising the approaches used to understand fisher decision making, with particular reference to location choice behaviour. It goes beyond a review of existing approaches by drawing on theory from disciplines outside fisheries research and formed the foundations of the methodology used for understanding fisher decision making in the southwest of England. In examination of individual behaviour, four typologies of fishers' strategic behaviour are identified using a framework drawn from the strategic management literature. A random utility model of location choice behaviour is presented and shows that southwest beam trawlers trade-off economic returns with knowledge transfer within the fleet and risk-aversion tactics. The acute fuel-price shock in 2008 provided the opportunity to examine the ability of, and barriers to, fishing enterprises and fishing communities adapting under changing and uncertain conditions. Increasing costs combined with strong market constraints on ex-vessel fish prices has resulted in lowered profitability for fishers which may have negative consequences for the sustainability and resilience of southwest English fishing fleets and fishing communities. This thesis shows that understanding aggregate fisher incentives can be achieved using an interdisciplinary approach and could enrich the design of fisheries governance systems for social-ecological sustainability and promotion of healthy fishing communities.},

The model is simulating the reference years 2009–2011. An overview of tidal prisms and residual volume fluxes of the main inlets and their variability is given. In addition, data from an intensive observational campaign in a tidal channel south of the island of Spiekeroog as well as satellite images and observations of sea surface properties from a ship of opportunity are used for the skill assessment. Finally, the intensity of estuarine overturning circulation and its variability in the tidal gullies are quantified and analyzed as function of gravitational and wind straining using various estimates including Total Exchange Flow (TEF). Regional differences between the gullies are assessed and drivers of the estuarine circulation are identified. For some inlets, the longitudinal buoyancy gradient dominates the exchange flow, for some others wind straining is more important. Also the intensity of tidal straining (scaled covariance of eddy viscosity and vertical shear) depends on buoyancy gradient and wind forcing in different ways, depending on local topography, orientation toward the main wind direction, and influence by freshwater run off inside or outside the tidal basin.},

We analyzed the simulation together with in situ observations. Coinciding with the decreasing nutrient level at the beginning of the 1990s, we find a surprising increase in phytoplankton in the German Bight, but not in the more offshore parts of the SNS. We explain these complex patterns by a series of factors which are lacking in many state-of-the-art coupled ecosystem models such as changed light availability and physiological acclimation in phytoplankton. We also show that many coastal time-series stations in the SNS are located in small patches where our model predicts an opposite trend than found for the surrounding waters. Together, these findings call for a reconsideration of current modeling and monitoring schemes.},

abstract = {The brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) fishery is economically one of the most important fisheries in the North Sea. Fishing is unregulated, apart from the number of licenses and technical measures. The fishery has long been considered sustainable in terms of the effect on the target species, even though annual stocks are not regularly assessed. Average landings constantly increased annually and since 2000 have been 40\% higher than in the 1980s and 1990s. Because brown shrimp lack a clear age structure and reproduce almost year-round, an age-based stock assessment is not possible. In the absence of a formal estimate of stock size, it is difficult to judge whether current fishing prac-tices can still be considered sustainable. Here, we use annual survey data collected during peak occurrence in late summer to obtain a depth-and area-stratified, swept-area estimate for the period 1970–2015. The resulting estimate of the total commercial-size shrimp bio-mass varied between 4000 and 21 000 tonnes over the years. Both parametric and non-parametric methods arrived at very similar results. In combination with length-based mortality estimates (as a proxy for production/biomass ratio), knowledge on the seasonal occurrence, catchability, gear efficiency, and their variation, total adult annual biomass production was estimated. Values ranged between 38 000 and 216 000 tonnes and overlapped at the lower end with total annual commercial landings, which varied between 8000 and 38 500 tonnes, in-dicating that in some years (1977, 1998, 2007), the larger part of the total brown shrimp production was harvested. Annual brown shrimp landings have gradually increased since the series started, whereas no trend in standing biomass and production was detected. Concurrent with the increase in landings, natural mortality of shrimp by predation has diminished. Considering the increase in fishing pressure and un-known consequence if natural predators recover or shrimp recruitment decreases, the lack of management for the brown shrimp fishery needs to be reconsidered.},

We reviewed 161 home range studies published in 2004, 2005, and 2006 to assess what methods are currently employed and how results are reported. We found that home range reporting was generally inadequate for reproducing studies; that the methods employed varied considerably; that home range estimates were often reported and analyzed using inappropriate methods; and that many comparisons were made between studies that may produce spurious results. We urge for minimum editorial standards for reporting home range studies and we urge researchers to follow a unified methodology for estimating animal home ranges. We supply recommendations for such reporting and methodology. These recommendations will increase the reproducibility of studies and allow for more robust comparisons between studies.},

abstract = {Mixed fisheries refer to fishing activities that catch more than one species simultaneously, and a species may be fished using different gear. A trawl fishery shares these features to exploit multiple species simultaneously, with diverse fishing gear and strategies. The situation becomes more complex when interactions among fleet dynamics, fishing activities, and fishery resources are involved and influence each other. Information regarding the operational patterns may be hidden in a set of long-term big data. This study aims to investigate the fishery structure and fleet dynamics of trawl fisheries in Taiwan for spatial planning and management, based on a long-term dataset from a management system that collects information by using voyage data recorders (VDR) and dockside observers. We applied a two-step data mining process with a clustering algorithm to classify the main groups of fishery resources and then identified 18 catch m{\'{e}}tiers based on catch composition. The target species, operation pattern, and fishing season were determined for each m{\'{e}}tier, and associated with the relevant fishery resources and the fishing gear used. Additionally, fishing effects on target species were estimated using information on fishing grounds and trajectories from VDR. The m{\'{e}}tier-based approach was successfully applied to define the six major fishery resources targeted by trawlers. We examined the key features of fishing activity associated with catch composition and spatial-temporal fishing metrics, which could be used to provide suggestions for the spatial planning and management of the mixed trawl fishery in the offshore waters of Taiwan.},

abstract = {Animal home range use is a central focus of ecological research. However, how and why home range size varies between individuals is not well studied or understood for most species. We develop a hierarchical analytical approach-using generalized linear mixed-effects modeling of time series of home range sizes-that allows variance in home range size to be decomposed into components due to variation in temporal, spatial, and individual-level processes, also facilitating intra- and interspecific comparative analyses. We applied the approach to data from a roe deer population radiotracked in central Italy. Over multiple timescales, temporal variation is explained by photoperiod and climate and spatial variation by the distribution of habitat types and spatial variance in radiotracking error. Differences between individuals explained a substantial amount of variance in home range size, but only a relatively minor part was explained by the individual attributes of sex and age. We conclude that the choice of temporal scale at which data are collected and the definition of home range can significantly influence biological inference. We suggest that the appropriate choice of scale and definition requires a good understanding of the ecology and life history of the study species. Our findings contrast with several common assumptions about roe deer behavior. {\textcopyright}2006 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract = {Blue mussels are among the most abundant bivalves in shallow water along the German coasts. As filter feeders, a major ecosystem service they provide is water filtration and the vertical transfer of suspended organic and attached inorganic material to the sea floor. Laboratory and field studies previously demonstrated that blue mussels can remove large quantities of plankton from the surrounding water. I here perform numerical experiments that investigate the effect of filtration at the scale of an entire coastal sea—the southern North Sea. These experiments were performed with a state-of-the-art bentho-pelagic coupled hydrodynamic and ecosystem model and used a novel reconstruction of the benthic biomass distribution of blue mussels. The filtration effect was assessed as the simulated change in net primary productivity caused by blue mussels. In shallow water, filtration takes out up to half of the entire annual primary productivity; it is negligible in offshore waters. For the entire basin, the filtration effect is 10%. While many ecosystem models have a global parameterization for filter feeders, the coastal gradient in the filtration effect is usually not considered; our research demonstrates the importance of including spatially heterogeneous filtration in coupled bentho-pelagic ecosystem models if we want to better understand the spatial patterns in shallow water coastal systems.},

abstract = {The energy cost of offspring is important in the conversion of resources allocated to reproduction to numbers of offspring, and in obtaining energy budget parameters from quantities that are easy to measure. An efficient numerical procedure is presented to obtain this cost for eggs and foetusses in the context of the dynamic energy budget theory, which specifies that birth occurs when maturity exceeds a threshold value and maternal effects determine the reserve density at birth. This paper extends previous work to arbitrary values of the ratio of the maturity and somatic maintenance costs. I discuss the body size scaling implications for the relative size and age at birth and conclude that the size at birth, contrary to the age at birth, covaries with the maintenance ratio. Apart from evolutionary adaptation of the maturity at birth, this covariation might explain some of the observed scatter in the relative length at birth. The theory can be used to evaluate the effects of the separation of cells in e.g. the two-cell stage of embryonic development, and of the removal of initial egg mass. If cell separation hardly affects energy parameters, body size scaling relationships imply that cell separation can only occur successfully in species with sufficiently large maximum body length (as adult); i.e. some two times that of Daphnia magna. Toxic compounds that increase the cost of synthesis of structure, decrease the allocation to reproduction indirectly via the life cycle, because food uptake is linked to size. They can also decrease the egg size, however, such that the reproduction rate is stimulated at low concentrations. The present theory offers a possible explanation for this well-known phenomenon.},

The brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) fishing industry in the Netherlands has been working on the implementation of a self-management strategy since 2007, as part of its ambition to get certified to the Marine Stewardship Council standard. Part of the self-management strategy is the development of a harvest control rule for reducing fishing effort when catches are low. Until recently, these attempts failed. The failure of the initiatives for self-management is examined within Ostrom's nested framework for understanding institutions for managing resource use. This framework emphasises the importance of strong vertical embeddedness of institutional arrangements for resource (co)management. Our analysis shows that, despite a strong vertical embeddedness, mismatches between different institutional frameworks at the same level (horizontal interaction) affect the performance of self-management at the organizational level. This inhibits the resource users' collective actions to self-manage their brown shrimp fishery, leading to a potential commons tragedy.},

abstract = {1. Climate change impacts have been observed on individual species and species subsets; however, it remains to be seen whether there are systematic, coherent assemblage-wide responses to climate change that could be used as a representative indicator of changing biological state. 2. European shelf seas are warming faster than the adjacent land masses and faster than the global average. We explore the year-by-year distributional response of North Sea bottom-dwelling (demersal) fishes to temperature change over the 25 years from 1980 to 2004. The centres of latitudinal and depth distributions of 28 fishes were estimated from species-abundance-location data collected on an annual fish monitoring survey. 3. Individual species responses were aggregated into 19 assemblages reflecting physiology (thermal preference and range), ecology (body size and abundance-occupancy patterns), biogeography (northern, southern and presence of range boundaries), and susceptibility to human impact (fishery target, bycatch and non-target species). 4. North Sea winter bottom temperature has increased by 1.6°C over 25 years, with a 1°C increase in 1988-1989 alone. During this period, the whole demersal fish assemblage deepened by ∼3.6 m decade-1 and the deepening was coherent for most assemblages. 5. The latitudinal response to warming was heterogeneous, and reflects (i) a northward shift in the mean latitude of abundant, widespread thermal specialists, and (ii) the southward shift of relatively small, abundant southerly species with limited occupancy and a northern range boundary in the North Sea. 6. Synthesis and applications. The deepening of North Sea bottom-dwelling fishes in response to climate change is the marine analogue of the upward movement of terrestrial species to higher altitudes. The assemblage-level depth responses, and both latitudinal responses, covary with temperature and environmental variability in a manner diagnostic of a climate change impact.

abstract = {The interaction between economic and ecologic dynamic systems is analyzed with a multi-player dynamic game, in which each player invests and allocates available capital to the production or consumption of natural resources and goods, and evaluates the outcome of all players' actions as well as the reactions of the ecosystem. During the course of repeated actions a dynamic process evolves such that the players adapt the amount of investment and the direction of its allocation according to their action preferences. For stability of the interaction matrix the players can form stable coalitions. Cooperation and negotiation on the amount and the allocation of investment could lead to more sustainable use of natural resources. The dynamic coalition-formation process corresponds to a self-organized transition from unilateral action (Nash equilibria) to multilateral cooperation (Pareto optima). With increasing number of players the complexity-stability tradeoff limits the stable coalition size. As an example for resource conflicts the exploitation of fish resources is simulated, for different fish populations and different players harvesting fish. {\textcopyright} 2000 IMACS.

abstract = {The state of the art of the numerics of hydrostatic structured-grid coastal ocean models is reviewed here. First, some fundamental differences in the hydrodynamics of the coastal ocean, such as the large surface elevation variation compared to the mean water depth, are contrasted against large scale ocean dynamics. Then the hydrodynamic equations as they are used in coastal ocean models as well as in large scale ocean models are presented, including parameterisations for turbulent transports. As steps towards discretisation, coordinate transformations and spatial discretisations based on a finite-volume approach are discussed with focus on the specific requirements for coastal ocean models. As in large scale ocean models, splitting of internal and external modes is essential also for coastal ocean models, but specific care is needed when drying & flooding of intertidal flats is included. As one obvious characteristic of coastal ocean models, open boundaries occur and need to be treated in a way that correct model forcing from outside is transmitted to the model domain without reflecting waves from the inside. Here, also new developments in two-way nesting are presented. Single processes such as internal inertia-gravity waves, advection and turbulence closure models are discussed with focus on the coastal scales. Some overview on existing hydrostatic structured-grid coastal ocean models is given, including their extensions towards non-hydrostatic models. Finally, an outlook on future perspectives is made.},

As a standardized document for providing a consistent, logical and readable account of the structure and dynamics of ABMs, some research groups also find it useful as a workflow for model design. Even so, there are still limitations to ODD that obstruct its more widespread adoption. Such limitations are discussed and addressed in this paper: the limited availability of guidance on how to use ODD; the length of ODD documents; limitations of ODD for highly complex models; lack of sufficient details of many ODDs to enable reimplementation without access to the model code; and the lack of provision for sections in the document structure covering model design ratio-nale, the model's underlying narrative, and the means by which the model's fitness for purpose is evaluated. We document the steps we have taken to provide better guidance on: structuring complex ODDs and an ODD summary for inclusion in a journal article (with full details in supplementary material; Table 1); using ODD to point readers to relevant sections of the model code; update the document structure to include sections on model rationale and evaluation. We also further advocate the need for standard descriptions of simulation experiments and argue that ODD can in principle be used for any type of simulation model. Thereby ODD would provide a lingua franca for simulation modelling.},

abstract = {Developing a typology of heterogeneous fishing practices through the use of m{\'{e}}tier analysis is a useful step in understanding the dynamics of fishing fleets and enabling effective implementation of management outcomes. We develop a non-hierarchical clustering framework to quantitatively categorize individual fishing events to a particular m{\'{e}}tier based on corresponding catch composition, gear configuration, and spatial and temporal references. Our clustering framework has several innovations over predecessors including: (i) introducing alternative methods for encoding and transforming fisheries data; (ii) variable (feature) selection methods; (iii) complementary metrics and methods for internal m{\'{e}}tier validation; and (iv) use of a network science method to model and analyze fishing practices. To demonstrate applicability, we apply this framework to the Australian Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF), a multispecies pelagic longline fishery with a diversity of fishing practices. We identified a total of seven stable m{\'{e}}tiers within the ETBF. While each m{\'{e}}tier was characterized by a predominant target species, they were differentiated more by seasonal and temporal references (e.g., time of set, month, latitude) than gear configuration (e.g., hooks per basket) or target species. By collapsing a large amount of high-dimensional operational data into a relatively uniform and limited number of components, decision-makers can more easily evaluate the likely consequences of management and design policies that target a particular m{\'{e}}tier.},

Habitat use sequences are expressed as annotations obtained by intersecting GPS movement trajectories with environmental layers. Here, we develop IM-SAM, where we use the individual reference area of use as the reference spatial context. To assess IM-SAM's applicability, we investigated the sequential use of open and closed habitats across multiple European roe deer populations ranging in landscapes with contrasting structure. Starting from simulated sequences based on a mechanistic movement model, we found that different sequential patterns of habitat use were distinguished as separate, robust clusters, with less variable cluster size when habitats were present in equal proportions within the individual reference area of use. Application on real roe deer sequences showed that our approach effectively captured variation in spatio-temporal patterns of sequential habitat use, and provided evidence for important behavioral processes, such as day-night habitat alternation. By characterizing sequential habitat use patterns of animals, we may better evaluate the temporal trade-offs in animal habitat use and how they are affected by changes in landscapes.},

abstract = {Worldwide, fisheries face the consequences of climate change and compete with expanding human activities at sea, which may trigger unforeseen reactions of fishers. Hence, knowledge on drivers of fishing behavior is crucial for management and needs to be integrated in resource management policies. In this study, we identify factors influencing fishing activity of North Sea demersal fleets. First, we explore drivers of the North Sea demersal fisheries in scientific literature. Subsequently, we study the effects of identified drivers on the spatio-temporal dynamics of German demersal fisheries using boosted regression trees (BRT), a supervised machine learning technique. An exploratory literature review revealed a lack of studies incorporating biophysical, economic and socio-cultural fishing drivers in a single quantitative analysis. Our BRT analysis contributed to filling this research gap and highlighted the importance of biophysical drivers such as temperature, salinity, and bathymetry for fishing behavior. Contrary to findings of previous studies, our empirical analysis identified quotas and market prices to be irrelevant, except for low brown shrimp prices, which counter-intuitively increased fishing effort. Moreover, economic and socio-cultural variables influencing brown shrimp fishing effort differed from the other fleets, especially determined by increased effort on workdays and reduced effort when fuel prices were high. Our findings provide key information for marine spatial planning and supports the integration of fishing fleet behavior into policies.},

The Danish fishermen apply different investment strategies in their businesses and in their everyday fishing tactics. This article investigates these fishermen's tactical and strategic decisions by using both in-depth sequence interviews and a questionnaire. It shows that the fishermen often include an array of conditions in their decision-making process with reference to tactics or strategies-the degree of flexibility concerning geography and gear, expectations for time off (family and friends), safety, comfort and expectations for economic outcome or willingness to take financial risks. Further, three types of fishermen are identified. The paper concludes that there is scope for management to become more flexible in order to better accommodate the specific challenges facing the different fisheries. {\textcopyright}2006.},

Our goal is to identify spatial strategies and their possible changes over 2000-2009. The data comprise more than 350,000 fishing trips, recorded using a vessel monitoring system. On-board observers monitored a small fraction of those trips (>2000), providing data for inferring the type of activity (fishing, searching, and cruising) from the position records, for use in a state-space model. Each fishing trip was characterized by its duration, maximum distance to the coast, geographical extension, and time spent fishing, searching and cruising. Using clustering techniques, we identified four types of fishing trips, associated with differences in management among regions, fleet segments, and skippers' behavior. The methodology could be used to investigate fishing spatial strategies using VMS trajectories in other fisheries.},

After decades of overfishing since industrialization, many global fish stocks have recovered, a change brought about through effective management. We provide a synthetic overview of three approaches that managers use to sustain stocks: regulating catch and fishing mortality, regulating effort and regulating spatial access. Within each of these approaches, we describe common restrictions, how they alter incentives to change fishing behaviour, and the resultant ecological, economic and community-level outcomes. For each approach, we present prominent case-studies that illustrate behaviour and the corresponding performance. These case-studies show that sustaining target stocks requires a hard limit on fishing mortality under most conditions, but that additional measures are required to generate economic benefits. Different systems for allocation allow stakeholder communities to strike a locally acceptable balance between profitability and employment.},

abstract = {Brown shrimps (Crangon crangon) occur in high densities in the southern North Sea and support a large, but so far unmanaged fishery with >500 vessels. Cohort-based stock assessment is not possible, and catch per unit effort from scientific surveys and commercial landings are the only variables collected. Landings per unit effort are currently used to approximate the state of stock and to trigger catch restrictions, but, although decisive in interpreting unit catches or landings, factors affecting catch rates are rarely understood. Using data from two long-term (1997-2010) scientific surveys conducted in autumn and winter, respectively, in the southern North Sea and from a vertically resolving stow net deployed at two stations in the German Wadden Sea (2005-2007), we investigate the effects of season, reproductive state, size, tidal state, daylight, and water depth on catch rates of brown shrimp. Log-linear random intercept models revealed an influence of all factors examined on the catch rate. Depth had a clear effect on the composition of size and reproductive state, supporting the hypothesis that brown shrimp utilize selective tidal stream transport to migrate to depths preferred during certain periods within their life cycle. The vertical distribution of brown shrimp across the water column revealed that on average two thirds to three quarters of the brown shrimps were located above reach of the standard shrimp catching gear. Our findings indicate that multiple factors and interactions affect catch rates of brown shrimp and, thus, need to be accounted for when interpreting unit catches or landings for management purposes. We suggest that brown shrimps are not primarily demersal, and that stock size estimates solely relying on beam trawl data may underestimate the true density of shrimps per area.},

abstract = {Recent studies have established the ecological and evolutionary importance of animal personalities. Individual differences in movement and space-use, fundamental to many personality traits (e.g. activity, boldness and exploratory behaviour) have been documented across many species and contexts, for instance personality-dependent dispersal syndromes. Yet, insights from the concurrently developing movement ecology paradigm are rarely considered and recent evidence for other personality-dependent movements and space-use lack a general unifying framework. We propose a conceptual framework for personality-dependent spatial ecology. We link expectations derived from the movement ecology paradigm with behavioural reaction-norms to offer specific predictions on the interactions between environmental factors, such as resource distribution or landscape structure, and intrinsic behavioural variation. We consider how environmental heterogeneity and individual consistency in movements that carry-over across spatial scales can lead to personality-dependent: (1) foraging search performance; (2) habitat preference; (3) home range utilization patterns; (4) social network structure and (5) emergence of assortative population structure with spatial clusters of personalities. We support our conceptual model with spatially explicit simulations of behavioural variation in space-use, demonstrating the emergence of complex population-level patterns from differences in simple individual-level behaviours. Consideration of consistent individual variation in space-use will facilitate mechanistic understanding of processes that drive social, spatial, ecological and evolutionary dynamics in heterogeneous environments.},

abstract = {The study and classification of fishers' behaviour remains a much debated topic. There is a tension between detailed empirical studies, which highlight the variety and diversity of fisheries, and the parsimony and generalization required to satisfy science and policy demands. This study contributes to this debate. The first section reviews quantitative methods currently used for classifying fishing practices. The review uncovers significant weaknesses in quantitative classification methods, which, we argue, can be improved through the complementary use of qualitative methods. To this purpose, we introduce the concept of ‘fishing style', which integrates quantitative classification methods with qualitative analysis. We explain the scientific premises of the fishing-style concept, outline a general methodological framework and present a fishing-style analysis of Swedish Baltic Sea fisheries. Based on these results, we conclude that it is possible to classify fishing practices in a relatively uniform and limited number of styles that can highlight the rich, empirical diversity of fishers' behaviour. We therefore propose that fishing-style analysis, based on an integration of quantitative and qualitative methods, can be an important step towards more effective and sustainable fisheries management.},

The Coastal Observing System for Northern and Arctic Seas (COSYNA) was established in order to better understand the complex interdisciplinary processes of northern seas and the Arctic coasts in a changing environment. Particular focus is given to the German Bight in the North Sea as a prime example of a heavily used coastal area, and Svalbard as an example of an Arctic coast that is under strong pressure due to global change.The COSYNA automated observing and modelling system is designed to monitor real-time conditions and provide short-term forecasts, data, and data products to help assess the impact of anthropogenically induced change. Observations are carried out by combining satellite and radar remote sensing with various in situ platforms. Novel sensors, instruments, and algorithms are developed to further improve the understanding of the interdisciplinary interactions between physics, biogeochemistry, and the ecology of coastal seas. New modelling and data assimilation techniques are used to integrate observations and models in a quasi-operational system providing descriptions and forecasts of key hydrographic variables. Data and data products are publicly available free of charge and in real time. They are used by multiple interest groups in science, agencies, politics, industry, and the public.},

Analyses start with standardized data formats for logbook (EFLALO) and VMS (TACSAT), enabling users to conduct a variety of analyses using generic algorithms. Embedded functionality handles erroneous data point detection and removal, m{\'{e}}tier identification through the use of clustering techniques, linking logbook and VMS data together in order to distinguish fishing from other activities, provide high-resolution maps of both fishing effort and -landings, interpolate vessel tracks, calculate indicators of fishing impact as listed under the Data Collection Framework at different spatio-temporal scales. Finally data can be transformed into other existing formats, for example to populate regional databases like FishFrame. This paper describes workflow examples of these features while online material allows a head start to perform these analyses.

abstract = {One of the most striking patterns at the land–ocean interface is the massive increase of chlorophyll-a (CHL) from continental shelves towards the coast, a phenomenon that is classically linked to physical features. Here I propose that the coastal–offshore CHL gradient in a shallow sea has biological origins related to phytoplankton mortality that are neglected in state-of-the-art biogeochemical models. I integrate a trait-based ecosystem model into a modular coupling framework that is applied to the southern North Sea (SNS). The coupled model very well reproduces daily, seasonal and inter-annual (2000-2014) dynamics and meso-scale patterns in macronutrients, zooplankton biomass, and CHL as observed in situ and by remote sensors. Numerical experiments reveal that coast–offshore CHL gradients may predominantly arise from a trophic effect as resolved by an increase in carnivorous grazing towards shallow waters. This carnivory gradient reflects higher near-coast abundance of juvenile fish and benthic filter feeders. Furthermore, the temporal evolution of CHL can be much affected by viral infection as a fast-responding loss process at intermediate to high phytoplankton concentrations. Viral control in the model also prevents excessive and unrealistic blooms during late spring. Herbivores as often only ecological factor considered for explaining the spatio-temporal phytoplankton distribution are in this study supplemented by pathogens as well as pelagic and benthic carnivores as powerful agents, which are barely represented in current modeling but can mediate physical drivers of coastal ecosystems.},

abstract = {Individual tracking of commercial fishing vessels from vessel monitoring systems (VMS) is now widely available across Europe for scientific purposes. This enables analyses of the spatial and temporal distribution of disaggregated fishing activity as well as high resolution determination of the consequent relative fishing pressure on stocks, provided that an accurate method can link these data with the declaration of catches (logbooks). In the present study, logbook analyses to allocate the fishing activity due to various fisheries (fleet segments) are integrated with processing of raw satellite-recorded data for identifying trips at sea and fishing sequences. Both data sources are linked into one output dataset. A robust method is developed to allocate logbook catches to VMS positions, with focus on potential mismatch. The method is applied to data on the Danish Skagerrak-Kattegat fishing fleets from 2005 to 2008, where 52-56% of the VMS total effort perfectly matched (representing approximately 80% of landings); 14-18% partially matched; and 30% failed to match the logbook data, which was partially related to fleet type, area and year. Comparison of three methods for generating high resolution determination of grid-based fishing effort demonstrated only minor differences, suggesting a mainly equal dispatch of landings between each of the merged fishing positions. Despite possibly poor matching success for this particular region, we demonstrate that the approach can cope with the potentially large sources of error in the data, including the current low accuracy of available VMS pre-processing algorithms and the possible misreporting of areas and catch dates in fishermen's logbook declarations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Effective management of social-ecological systems (SESs) requires an understanding of human behavior. In many SESs, there are hundreds of agents or more interacting with governance and regulatory institutions, driving management outcomes through collective behavior. Agents in these systems often display consistent behavioral characteristics over time that can help reduce the dimensionality of SES data by enabling the assignment of types. Typologies of resource-user behavior both enrich our knowledge of user cultures and provide critical information for management. Here, we develop a data-driven framework to identify resource-user typologies in SESs with high-dimensional data. To demonstrate policy applications, we apply the framework to a tightly coupled SES, commercial fishing. We leverage large fisheries-dependent datasets that include mandatory vessel logbooks, observer datasets, and high-resolution geospatial vessel tracking technologies. We first quantify vessel and behavioral characteristics using data that encode fishers' spatial decisions and behaviors. We then use clustering to classify these characteristics into discrete fishing behavioral types (FBTs), determining that 3 types emerge in our case study. Finally, we investigate how a series of disturbances applied selection pressure on these FBTs, causing the disproportionate loss of one group. Our framework not only provides an efficient and unbiased method for identifying FBTs in near real time, but it can also improve management outcomes by enabling ex ante investigation of the consequences of disturbances such as policy actions.},

The coastal mixed-species multi-gear Portuguese fleet comprises medium-sized (>12 m) vessels, using a diversity of passive gears, and is economically important. For hake (under a recovery plan) and monkfish (overexploited), it contributes >50% to their total annual landings. Commercial daily landings in 2005 from 271 vessels were analysed by region using non-hierarchical cluster analysis and multivariate regression trees. The cluster analysis allowed the identification of regional fleet segments with a low mixture of species throughout the year. The multivariate regression trees were applied to clusters of vessels with a high mixture of species, to explain weekly landing profiles (species) by vessel technical characteristics, fishing license, and main landing port. The results showed a link between exploited species and geographic location, and in the north between vessel size and depth and an inshore/offshore range. Finally, from the analysis and for the most important species exploited by the Portuguese multi-gear fleet, it was possible to define two or three vessel groups that accounted for at least 50% of the landed value. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {Fisheries using bottom trawls are the most widespread source of anthropogenic physical disturbance to seafloor habitats. To mitigate such disturbances, the development of fisheries-, conservation-, and ecosystem-based management strategies requires the assessment of the impact of bottom trawling on the state of benthic biota. We explore a quantitative and mechanistic framework to assess trawling impact. Pressure and impact indicators that provide a continuous pressure–response curve are estimated at a spatial resolution of 1 $\chi$ 1 min latitude and longitude ($\sim$2 km2) using three methods: L1 estimates the proportion of the community with a life span exceeding the time interval between trawling events; L2 estimates the decrease in median longevity in response to trawling; and population dynamic (PD) estimates the decrease in biomass in response to trawling and the recovery time. Although impact scores are correlated, PD has the best performance over a broad range of trawling intensities. Using the framework in a trawling impact assessment of ten m{\'{e}}tiers in the North Sea shows that muddy habitats are impacted the most and coarse habitats are impacted the least. Otter trawling for crustaceans has the highest impact, followed by otter trawling for demersal fish and beam trawling for flatfish and flyshooting. Beam trawling for brown shrimps, otter trawling for industrial fish, and dredging for molluscs have the lowest impact. Trawling is highly aggregated in core fishing grounds where the status of the seafloor is low but the catch per unit of effort (CPUE) per unit of impact is high, in contrast to peripheral grounds, where CPUE per unit of impact is low.},

Although individual Nephrops populations are scattered, the crustacean is managed regionally by the European Union (EU). The spatial competition for fisheries in the North Sea is growing especially due to expanding offshore wind farms (OWF) and newly implemented marine protected areas (MPA). Moreover, the Brexit affects the availability of EU fishing quotas and adds to the overall uncertainty EU fishers face. We compare landings and catches to scientifically advised quantities and perform an overlap analysis of fishing grounds with current and future OWFs and MPAs. Furthermore, we explore the German Nephrops fleet using high-resolution spatial fishing effort and catch data. Our results confirm earlier studies showing that Nephrops stocks have been fished above scientific advice. Present OWFs and MPAs marginally overlap with Nephrops fishing grounds, whereas German fishing grounds are covered up to 45% in future scenarios. Co-use strategies with OWFs could mitigate the loss of fishing opportunities. Decreased cod quotas due to Brexit and worse stock conditions, lowers Germany's capability to swap Nephrops quotas with the UK. We support the call for a new management strategy of individual Nephrops populations and the promotion of selective fishing gears.},

In parallel, sophisticated tools have been developed to process, visualize and analyse tracking data; however, many of these tools have proliferated in isolation, making it challenging for users to select the most appropriate method for the question in hand. Indeed, within the r software alone, we listed 58 packages created to deal with tracking data or ‘tracking packages'. Here, we reviewed and described each tracking package based on a workflow centred around tracking data (i.e. spatio-temporal locations (x, y, t)), broken down into three stages: pre-processing, post-processing and analysis, the latter consisting of data visualization, track description, path reconstruction, behavioural pattern identification, space use characterization, trajectory simulation and others. Supporting documentation is key to render a package accessible for users. Based on a user survey, we reviewed the quality of packages' documentation and identified 11 packages with good or excellent documentation. Links between packages were assessed through a network graph analysis. Although a large group of packages showed some degree of connectivity (either depending on functions or suggesting the use of another tracking package), one third of the packages worked in isolation, reflecting a fragmentation in the r movement-ecology programming community. Finally, we provide recommendations for users when choosing packages, and for developers to maximize the usefulness of their contribution and strengthen the links within the programming community.},
