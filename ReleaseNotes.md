- updated OWF data and historic timeline of extent

# Release notes for version 1.2.0 - Sep 6, 2023

Version 1.2.0 is a feature release of our Viable North Sea (ViNoS) software. The
main purpose of this release are improvements to functionality of the trip
optimization.

- Keep gear fixed until it is explicitly changed, despite changing priorities
- Keep a record of `memory-size` for revisiting successful catch locations
- Cleanup towards Clean Code

- verified VIABLE approch in model
- Completed ODD

# Release notes for version 1.0.0 - April 17, 2023

Version 1.0.0 is the initial release of our Viable North Sea (ViNoS) software. The main purpose of this release is to open the research software to the public. This release features

- NetLogo 6.2 or NetLogo 6.3 as a development platform
- basic functionality of all agents and their interactions
- preliminary results generated and interpretable
- completed software infrastructure including license management and continuous integration (CI)
- submission of the software to the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)

Issues to look out for in the next version are stabilization of the software, a submission of the ODD protocol to COMSES.net, and more elaborate work on the fishery economics.
