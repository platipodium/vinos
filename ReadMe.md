# Agent-based Model of German North Sea fisheries

The North Sea small-vessel fleet targets plaice, sole, and crangon, predominantly.  The roundabout
200 boats leave German ports for one to few day fishing trips and offload their catch.  Fishers
compare costs and benefits to previous catches and may decide to change their fishing strategy, as
both the catch can vary with climate change and habitats for the target species, and the costs
for operating the boat and paying wages rise. 

## Implementation

The simulation model is implemented in the NetLogo framework, a graphical simulator and programming
environment developed for educational purposes.  The model can be found in the folder `netlogo` and 
can be started with a double-click on most operating systems after installation of NetLogo, 
available from https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/. 

## Data and supplementary routines

The simulation model uses open data available in the `data` folder.  Some of the routines to convert 
data into a format usable by the NetLogo model are available as R routines the folder `r`, and 
`python`, respectively.   You do not need R or python to run the simulation, unless you would like 
to recreate some of the data. 

## Using the model

Please refer to the `Info` tab in the graphical NetLogo model to learn more about the model, it's
mathematical implementation and how to use it.

## Licenses

The model is copyrighted by [University of Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de) and 
[Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon](https://www.hereon.de).  It is available under
the open source Apache 2.0 license.  You may freely use, distribute, and modify the model.  If you 
do so, you must acknowledge us.  

Some data and routines were also contributed by the Th√ºnen Institute, by Hochschule Bremerhaven, 
non-governmental organizations and government agencies, some are available under licences different
from Apache 2.0.  Please refer to the license information available for each individual file in 
this project for details.

We appreciate if you provided your feedback or bug reports and improvement
