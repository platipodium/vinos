# Natura 2000 protected areas

Natura 2000 is an ecological network of protected areas, set up to ensure the survival of Europe's most valuable species and habitats. Natura 2000 is based on the 1979 Birds Directive and the 1992 Habitats Directive. Natura 2000 is the key instrument to protect biodiversity in the European Union. The European database of Natura 2000 sites consists of a compilation of the data submitted by the Member States of the European Union and is generally updated once a year

The data can be obtained in various formats from
