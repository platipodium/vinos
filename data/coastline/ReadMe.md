# Southern North Sea Coastline

This is a shapefile of the SNS waterbody, generated from the EEA coastline polygon available at
https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/eea-coastline-for-analysis-2

The waterbody polygon was generated by

- adding a domain layer for entire domain North sea and Baltic sea
- subtracting coastline (land polygon) from domain layer resulting in waterbody
- adding a domain layer for only North sea
- clipping waterbody with North sea domain layer
